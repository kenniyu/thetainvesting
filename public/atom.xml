    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finally saw a bone thrown to the Bears camp. When traders accepted prices below the value area today, that was a bearish signal. All of this could change, but this is definitely an edge to the Bears.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>From a candlestick pattern analysis, on the SPX, we formed a Doji yesterday and traded below that. This is once again negative on the year, so watch for continuation here. 2060 could still be the target until we see more downside.</p>

<p>The DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>We fell back from tagging that trendline resistance mentioned a couple of days ago - we may be starting to pick up momentum, so similar to the SPX, watch for continuation as well.</p>

<p>The NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Trading Below 61.% Fibonacci Retracement Level" /></a></p>

<p>As it has been recently, it was the weakest of the bunch, closing today below the 200 DMA and trading right below the 61.8% fib.</p>

<p>The RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level - Look Above and Fail" /></a></p>

<p>The look-above-and-fail pattern confirmed today and we took out all the gains, now sitting at the 50% fib. Also monitor for continuation to the downside here.</p>

<p>Essentially, all indices pointing down, and in my opinion, we should continue to see lower prices.</p>

<p>Here are the trades we entered in today if you followed me on Twitter:</p>

<p>No management is necessary for all current and existing trades. These have been added to the <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/trades" title="Trades">Trades page</a>, with risk graphs shown. I try to keep the risk graphs up-to-date as often as possible.</p>

<p>With that, I&rsquo;ll leave us once again with just one trade idea for tomorrow - FXI:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png" alt="FXI - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Fade China" /></a></p>

<p>We had a nice pop from last week, and a nice rally for a whole month now. I think a fade play here would be nice. Something like selling the APR 34 call and buying the 32/31 put vertical. I&rsquo;ll tweet out the trade.</p>

<p>Remember that the markets are closed on Friday.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-22T20:38:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/22/decision-point</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market stalls here.</p>

<p>We had the SPX close today on a Doji - this doesn&rsquo;t mean a reversal is coming, it just means indecision, or consolidation, before a break out higher or lower. The longer we consolidate, the more forceful the breakout, so do keep that in mind. Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>We actually peeked above the consolidation area not once, but twice, since yesterday. While that may seem bearish, keep in mind we did the same look-below-and-fail today. So still, trade is being dominated by short-term traders.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Tag" /></a></p>

<p>It actually tagged that trendline resistance and fell back a bit, which was what we expected. If the markets continue to exhibit weakness tomorrow, I&rsquo;m considering the APR5 177.5/180 call spread going for .98 cr right now.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Grinding Higher" /></a></p>

<p>It actually continued higher today and was the strongest of the bunch. Not surprising here as it was the laggard for most of the huge rally that the SPX had.</p>

<p>And the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday we were looking for either a follow through higher from possibly a bounce off of the trendline support, but we did not get that. Earlier during today&rsquo;s session, it appeared that yesterday&rsquo;s session was nothing but a look-above-and-fail, but by the end of today, we didn&rsquo;t have a look-below-and-fail, either. Again, indecision here, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Overall, the indices spell very mixed signals. On one hand, you have the NDX up and the DJX down, but both SPX and RUT aren&rsquo;t sure where to go. The longer the market stays in a tight consolidation range, the more explosive the breakout. Stay aware.</p>

<p>Today we got filled on three trades:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still working the fly on it, but in the meantime: SOLD VERTICAL <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PCLN&amp;src=ctag">$PCLN</a> 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL <a href="https://twitter.com/1">@1</a>.25</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/712273450153283584">March 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>These trades are now being logged in the <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/trades" title="Trades">Trades page</a> section of the site, so we&rsquo;ll continue monitoring these trades and managing as necessary. Updates will be posted on that page over time.</p>

<p>Potential trades for tomorrow:</p>

<p>Earlier today I was looking at PCLN as a potential candidate for a balanced butterfly, centered around the 1300 level. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png" alt="PCLN - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Channel Support" /></a></p>

<p>There is an ascending trendline support which should end up at around 1300 by this Thursday. In the event of a slight downdraft in the markets, we may be able to find support here. There&rsquo;s also a rising channel support going back to the gap up from earnings. This should help the 1300 level act as a support as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln_risk_graph.png" alt="PCLN Risk Graph - 2016-03-22 - Balanced Butterfly" /></a></p>

<p>The 1310/1300/1290 butterfly is currently being priced for about .80 db. I&rsquo;ll be trying to lowball this for about .50.</p>

<p>And for DIA:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia.png" alt="DIA - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Short &amp; Long Strikes" /></a></p>

<p>In the market recap before, I mentioned that if the market exhibits weakness and we see all indices drop, a 177.5/180 call vertical on DIA would not be a bad idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png" alt="DIA Risk Graoh - 2016-03-22 - Vertical Credit Call Spread" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s currently being priced at about 1.01 cr for the spread expiring on APR5, but depending on when the fill happens and how much the market drops, it&rsquo;ll be lower.</p>

<p>Another trade idea here is GDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png" alt="GDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a bit of a pullback from this big run that we&rsquo;ve had. As GDX stalls here, I&rsquo;m hoping to collect some premium on the call side, possibly the APR 21.5 naked call, and I&rsquo;m also looking to add a more bearish bias, as we&rsquo;re at the top of this channel resistance. To that effect, I&rsquo;m considering buying the 20/19 put spread, also in APR. Together, this should bring in about .22 cr.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx_risk_graph.png" alt="GDX Risk Graph - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation" /></a></p>

    <updated>2016-03-21T19:05:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/21/expecting-a-turnaround-very-soon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We continue to grind higher.</p>

<p>SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Gap Fill" /></a></p>

<p>The 2060 target mentioned for a while now is just within reach. Due to the slowing momentum, I&rsquo;m looking to enter into a 2100/2110 short call vertical spread on the SPX, currently going for 1.70 cr once that trendline is reached and we exhibit signs of a turnaround.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Tag" /></a></p>

<p>We tagged the trendline resistance today. I am expecting this to stall around here, while the SPX climbs higher to tag its trendline.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>We crossed the 61.8% fib level today, so the next level of resistance is the trendline resistance. However, given the slowing momentum we have in all of the other indices, I don&rsquo;t expect NDX to actually reach that trendline resistance on this run.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>The RUT was the weakest of the bunch today, closing down, but still above the trendline support. We&rsquo;ll need to see more follow-through to the upside if the market were truly bullish, but that may be a bit hard given how much we&rsquo;ve come off from the lows, and also the fact that there is a 61.8% fib level there as well. I do expect some stalling to occur here, but keep an eye out on this, as we could easily fall below that support, making for a classic look-above-and-fail pattern.</p>

<p>The upcoming week is key and will most likely determine whether or not we get the retracement in the market that many, including me, have been looking for. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for those that followed me on Twitter, here is the trade we got filled on today:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s breaking support. BOT BUTTERFLY <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=ctag">$AMZN</a> 100 APR 16 480/475/465 PUT @-.17</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/711923212490121216">March 21, 2016</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>And the risk profile per spread:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/amzn_risk_profile.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/amzn_risk_profile.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Unbalanced Butterfly Risk Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the chart of AMZN on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/amzn.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/amzn.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Approximate Support" /></a></p>

<p>I expect us to find some support around the prior lows in the area of about 475 to 500. Because I didn&rsquo;t have a specific target in mind, only an approximate area, plus the fact that I think we&rsquo;ll stall around there, a theta-positive, risk-defined trade here may not be such a bad idea. If we aren&rsquo;t able to clearly break support (which we couldn&rsquo;t by the end of today, we actually had a look-below-and-fail) and we end up moving higher, we still make money. As for trade management, since we don&rsquo;t want to take on the max loss here, we&rsquo;ll be looking to manage if AMZN does indeed fall down hard.</p>

<p>Also, given how UNG closed today, I think we are in for another leg lower, and the measured target would be 5.61:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/ung.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/ung.png" alt="UNG - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance, Fibonacci Extension" /></a></p>

<p>I would like to see us break the lows of 5.78 first, though. As for the entry point, looking at the chart on an intraday basis, a break below 6.4 should trigger us into the short:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/ung_short_entry.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/ung_short_entry.png" alt="UNG - 2016-03-21 Hourly Time Frame - Short Entry Point" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to sell the APR5 6.5 call and buy the APR5 6 put for about .17 cr. Look out for my tweet on this.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, HD:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/hd.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03212016/hd.png" alt="HD - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I completely got sidetracked by work while an entry was available here today - unfortunately it seems like we&rsquo;re no longer able to get a credit for putting on the 133/135 call backratio right now (currently going for .09 debit). I&rsquo;ll continue monitoring this for a good entry, and I&rsquo;ll post it live on Twitter as well.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets tomorrow, and <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates in real-time.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/20/a-cheap-play-on-hd/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-20T15:51:23-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/20/a-cheap-play-on-hd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My stance on the market remains the same as I stated on Friday, so going into Monday, <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/" title="The Most Dangerous Aspect of the Recent Rally">keep these points in mind</a>.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s a trade idea going into Monday.</p>

<p>HD is approaching channel resistance:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03202016/hd.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03202016/hd.png" alt="HD - 2016-03-20 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I expect it to stall here before breaking out, as breakouts from 100% retracements are usually hard to achieve. For that reason, a call backratio would be great here:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03202016/hd_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03202016/hd_risk_graph.png" alt="HD Risk Graph - Call Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>Here, we pay a small debit of .06. The max profit is about $190 per spread, with the upside breakeven at  around 137 (unlimited loss if HD continues rising past this level), and the downside breakeven at around 135. We will monitor this trade closely, watching to see if HD signals a strong breakout over the resistance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on this trade on Monday; you can <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my real-time updates on  this and all of my other trade entries.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all know about the recent rally off of the February lows and how it has devastated the many short players out there. And as you know, I&rsquo;ve been harping about this in my recent posts - regardless of how ridiculous this rally may seem to many, we can&rsquo;t fight price action. The point here is that we should simply trade the trend. Thus, continue to keep the 2060 SPX target in mind.</p>

<p>However, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. While the Bulls sure have gotten quite the relief rally they needed after a terrible start in the first month of 2016, and while it may seem as though all is fine and dandy in the equities market because we&rsquo;re now positive on the year, I have one important message for those die-hard Bulls, or those who have missed out on this rally and are considering jumping in for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out" title="FOMO">FOMO</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Price is simply an advertising mechanism</p></blockquote>

<p>Price is simply an advertising mechanism. And yes, it&rsquo;s easy to get sucked in by price. We see it every day in our lives - the dealership we drive by promoting the price slash on that shiny car, the cheap deal from the restaurant serving up their burrito bowls with E. Coli additives, the ads on TV from Macy&rsquo;s promoting price cuts on their clothes, etc&hellip; But is there any value to these items? Some would argue so, since obviously transactions occurred here before, so of course it has value - someone just bought it at this price level.</p>

<p>But the existence of a transaction happening at that price does not provide enough information as to how much value it really provides. The missing dimensions are <strong>time</strong> and <strong>volume</strong> spent at those levels.</p>

<p>The longer the time that traders spend making transactions at a certain price level, the more value that area has. The same can be said for volume, and we&rsquo;ll take a deeper look at that now.</p>

<p>From a candlestick chart, it&rsquo;s hard to see time or volume spent at each of the individual prices/price ranges. So instead, we&rsquo;ll have to look at the <strong>market profile</strong>, specifically, the volume profile:</p>

<p>This is a rough volume profile of the /ES:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at this recent rally that we&rsquo;ve had, we can see how much time and volume was spent throughout each area of this up-move.</p>

<p>The first week of the rally was explosive - we gapped up repeatedly the first few days, creating &ldquo;single prints&rdquo; in the market profile as shorts panicked to cover their existing positions. What followed was consolidation around the 1940 area, and then another explosive move higher into the 2000 range before another consolidation, and then finally one more push to our current levels. Each of these pushes can be thought of as being built on &ldquo;poor structure.&rdquo; That means, not a lot of time was spent developing value throughout all of the areas of this rally - there were only two areas so far that we spent about a week or so, each, developing value in. A healthy market rally, instead of screaming higher with single prints, would gradually develop value higher and higher. The gradual, upward migration of value areas prevents a sell off from breaking through these value areas and eliminating longs quickly; more time and volume spent in these areas means there are many traders interested in prices at these levels.</p>

<p>In contrast, the sharp, &ldquo;gappy&rdquo; migration of value is very susceptible to liquidation breaks, as these single-prints or gaps have yet to be filled with value when revisited. However, once price revisits these levels, because no time was spent here, those who got long in these prices will most likely panic, as they did not get in at a value area, but at an area that they felt were &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to get in at because they were &ldquo;chasing&rdquo; bad location. Subsequently, a chain reaction occurs where longs liquidate at market (think of it as the opposite of a short squeeze).</p>

<p>Zooming out and looking at the bigger picture, when viewing the volume profile of the entire rally, we end up with this histogram on the right (chart shown again):</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>The volume bars on the right is the volume composite, or the sum of all of the volumes at the different price levels for the time frame we&rsquo;re looking at. In the time frame of this ongoing rally, we see that the high volume &ldquo;node&rdquo; currently exists at around 1986. This is the fairest price to do business. The second fairest would be at around 1920. Everything in between (the valleys) are subject to liquidation breaks. In essence, price tends to trade near peaks, and it tends to move away from valleys. Keep this information in mind for when we do begin to trade away from the peaks.</p>

<p>The tone out there in the market is very bullish, no doubt. But besides the <strong>extremely</strong> poor structure of this rally, another thing that bothers me about this rally is that it is the short term traders that have been dominating price action this past couple of weeks. The reason I say this with confidence is that short term traders usually look at short term time frame reference points, i.e. yesterday&rsquo;s high or low, overnight high or low, etc&hellip; and trade mechanically off of these points. And that&rsquo;s precisely what we&rsquo;ve had this past week - the prices at which the market has been bouncing from spell out very clearly that the action is dominated by exactly these players.</p>

<p>Specifically, I&rsquo;m looking at the 1995 level on the /ES:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/esm6_1995.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/esm6_1995.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - 1995 Weak Reference Point" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how many times we&rsquo;ve come to this level and bounced away from it. Also, notice the distribution areas boxed by the blue areas, with the single prints in between them:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/esm6_thurs_fri.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/esm6_thurs_fri.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Single Prints Separating Distributions as Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>On Thursday&rsquo;s RTH, we came to just 1 tick above the single print spike from Wednesday&rsquo;s RTH and bounced right from there. These weren&rsquo;t value area reference points, but rather short term reference points. Thus, in my opinion, they are weak and should be carried forward into the future for when we do come revisit these points. And when we do, <strong>don&rsquo;t be surprised if all of that poor structure which has been built by short term traders gets wiped out by a hard liquidation break</strong>.</p>

<p>Going forward, I believe we continue rallying to around 2060 in the SPX next week. If we close at or below that point next week, then I think the play would be to take a short there. If we continue selling off, keep those weak reference points I mentioned earlier in mind and know that they are just that: <em>weak</em>. We may see a slight bounce at 1995 given how many times we&rsquo;ve touched this point, but understand that, because it&rsquo;s a weak reference point, it would probably break on a subsequent touch downwards.</p>

<p>So, if you&rsquo;re a die-hard Bull, or if you&rsquo;ve been dying to get in the market, but you haven&rsquo;t yet, it is now very late, so if you do decide to jump in, please be careful and keep those reference points in mind. It is all too easy to fall into the trap of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality," title="chasing price">chasing price</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We filled the gap today on the SPX from last year&rsquo;s close today:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03172016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03172016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-17 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Gap Fill" /></a></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue monitoring the higher movement we&rsquo;ve had for continuation.</p>

<p>The market is dangerously long here, and I mention that due to the multiple poor structures that this rally has made to get up to where it is right now. This makes the market susceptible to huge liquidation breaks once the bigger players step in. For now, I still don&rsquo;t see many long term players coming in. The action feels very squeezed, but it can continue higher. 2060 is that target I&rsquo;m aiming for.</p>

<p>For tomorrow, keep an eye out on SPX to see if we find acceptance here. I think we may stall here for a bit as the players from last year decide whether or not to hold or get out. Thus, value may build here before we move higher.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-16T19:27:04-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/16/market-continues-to-upside</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yellen did it again, and the markets rally higher. Let&rsquo;s take a look:</p>

<p>As mentioned for a while now, SPX is still on track to tag the 2060 level:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-16 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Harmonic Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve outlined the range of last year&rsquo;s October rally and duplicated that line over to the rally we&rsquo;ve had from February to estimate the target of this rally (AKA Harmonic Pattern), and it matches perfectly with the descending trendline resistance. Given this projection, we should reach that target zone in about two weeks.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that SPX opened this year at 2038.2. Look for some resistance over there as well. A failure to take this market back up through the open (just like in day-trading when we fail to take out the open) is a short signal. But if we plow through this and move higher with ease, expect 2060.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-16 Daily Time Frame - Descending Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Pretty bullish here. It just broke the descending trendline resistance, which makes a big dent in the bear case. The next target is that next trendline resistance.</p>

<p>Moving over to the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-16 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci" /></a></p>

<p>This tagged the 61.8% fib today and backed off, but given how all the other indices look, this would have no problem busting through it that, which makes the next target the descending trendline resistance.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03162016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-16 Daily Time Frame - Bull Flag" /></a></p>

<p>Though it&rsquo;s weak, we could be setting up for a bull flag breakout.</p>

<p>Watch all of the indices closely. The best trade idea for SPX is setting up a butterfly with the short strikes centered at 2060, expiring on Mar5.</p>

<p>That wraps it up for today. Trade safe, and trade small. Good luck in the markets!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I mentioned a possible long/short trade on AUD/JPY depending on how we close today. Unfortunately for the Bull case, we weren&rsquo;t able to close above that lower price level. Still for the Bear case, I&rsquo;d like to see us breach the 85 level before initiating a short, so this is still a wait-and-see.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/aud_jpy.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/aud_jpy.png" alt="AUD/JPY - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame " /></a></p>

<p>I also mentioned shorting natural gas if UNG floats up to the price level shown here:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/ung.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/ung.png" alt="UNG - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame" /></a></p>

<p>We did not get that today, so this is also still a wait-and-see.</p>

<p>Looking at /GC, we&rsquo;ve stalled since ECB, and we&rsquo;re currently testing some trendline support levels:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/gc_f.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/gc_f.png" alt="/GC - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target 1200 Support" /></a></p>

<p>If we do break lower, I&rsquo;d imagine the next level of support is around 1200, and if so, we could easily reach that target within the next 2 weeks. One trade idea here is the 1210/1200/1185 unbalanced butterfly:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/gc_f_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/gc_f_risk_graph.png" alt="/GC Risk Graph - 1210/1200/1185 Put Unbalanced Butterfly - Max Profit at 1200" /></a></p>

<p>This trade can basically be put on for free or even for a credit, but will need to be managed in case gold does plunge back down hard. I will be monitoring /GC and will be tweeting out my entry.</p>

<p>Another one is BIDU:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/bidu.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/bidu.png" alt="BIDU - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Topping-Tail Hammer" /></a></p>

<p>Below 178.92 is a short, but I&rsquo;ll be watching FXI for follow through as well:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/fxi.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/fxi.png" alt="FXI - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>If FXI stalls at that resistance, I&rsquo;ll be looking to sell some call spreads on BIDU. One trade idea is the 200/205 call spread, currently going for 1.03 cr.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/14/short-term-traders-continue-to-dominate/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-14T17:09:23-07:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll give a short market update on the broad market indices and then save a post later for possible trade ideas.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s price action continues to show some short-term traders here dominating. On the /ES, we tagged the single prints separating the two distributions on Friday, and then instead of pushing prices lower, we backed off and traded back upwards. This shows that shorter term traders are just trading responsively, and it also shows that they&rsquo;re just lacking confidence to push this higher or lower. Furthermore, we closed on a Doji today, so another reason we&rsquo;ve got a low confidence market.</p>

<p>SPX is still on track to tag the 2060 level, though to me, the market feels really heavy, and we might not get there. Watch for a possible reversal or breakout tomorrow, as we basically spent the whole day today balancing thus forming that Doji:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Doji" /></a></p>

<p>NDX crept higher today, and will probably slowly float upwards to the 61.8% fib level:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target 61.8% Fibonacci ~ 4415" /></a></p>

<p>DJX also looks like it wants to tag that trendline resistance:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>RUT here kind of stalling. Continue to monitor that trendline to see if we break it to the upside or fail back down:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03142016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Continue to monitor the markets closely. Again, I feel like traders are just tired of pushing prices higher, but we also have Janet stepping up to the mic on Wednesday, so be careful and trade cautiously.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/13/commodity-and-volatility-play</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Natural gas has been one of the commodities that just can&rsquo;t seem to get it up. Observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03132016/ung.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03132016/ung.png" alt="UNG - Natural Gas - 2016-03-13 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>A good place to short this commodity would be at the horizontal price level, so wait for a bit more of a retracement higher before entering. If we do turn lower before getting up there, then we&rsquo;ll have missed out, but our risk/reward would have been better as well.</p>

<p>My favorite currency pair to look at for market volatility opportunities is the AUD/JPY:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03132016/aud_jpy.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03132016/aud_jpy.png" alt="AUD/JPY - Australian Dollar / Japanese Yen - 2016-03-13 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>When volatility starts picking up, look for the AUD to weaken and the JPY to strengthen. This pair should head lower if we do start to see volatility increase. If AUD/JPY starts to roll over, then the first target would be 85, then 83.3, and then 82. But if we continue to see strength in the markets, this pair can break into the region bounded by the two horizontal price levels. Look for the strength of the breakout and the tempo in the equities market as well as confirmation to enter, with a tight stop just below the lower price level - the 85.61 from the highs of Thursday&rsquo;s session would be a good place.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-12T12:14:17-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/12/thoughts-on-the-market</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I have not participated as much as I should have in the rally from the February lows.</p>

<p>In hindsight, that is the biggest mistake I&rsquo;ve made this year. It was clearly a double bottom, and when fueled by short-covering, became a very powerful rally. All I had to do was go long the market, or any stock for that matter, and I would&rsquo;ve been able to capture a lot more gains. Instead, I focused on the points that the market could possibly stall and turn around to go lower, and I was prepared to short at those points. And because I was so focused on preparing to short, I did not think about going long.</p>

<p>Obviously, that type of thinking has caused me a lot of lost opportunities. So, in order to correct this behavior, and to help set it in stone, I think it&rsquo;s beneficial for me to write out these thoughts so that I can come back here whenever similar situations occur in the future and set myself straight.</p>

<p>As much as I&rsquo;m punishing myself for missing out on the rally, my sentiment on the market still remains - I don&rsquo;t believe in the rally that we&rsquo;ve had from the February lows. That does not mean I won&rsquo;t be taking advantage of any bullish signals and trading them. It simply means, fundamentally, I don&rsquo;t believe our economy is any better. I believe our central bankers will run out of juice one day. At some point, the market has to correct, and I just don&rsquo;t see us making new highs in our current conditions.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the famous, big-name stocks like FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, CMG, AAPL, etc. I would&rsquo;ve expected these stocks to rally a lot higher in conjunction with the SPX - at least if it had done so, it would&rsquo;ve shown that risk was back on. Instead, they all look very weak; it doesn&rsquo;t seem like investors are all that excited about these stocks anymore. Furthermore, it appears we&rsquo;ve rotated to defensive sector stocks like energy, and based off of what? Crude oil&rsquo;s fundamentals being better? I don&rsquo;t think so. In fact, I have no idea.</p>

<p>We started this year at 2038.2 in the SPX. We&rsquo;re currently at 2022.19. If we breach 2038.2 with vigor, I believe the next point of resistance is 2060 (highlighted by the gray oval):</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03122016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03122016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-12 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>Because a lot of overhead supply is above us, I think it makes sense that we won&rsquo;t be surging sharply higher - instead, we&rsquo;ll probably slowly float upwards. So I&rsquo;ll leave you with a trade idea: the 2055/2060/2070 unbalanced butterfly (currently priced for 0.15 cr) expiring March:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03122016/spx_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03122016/spx_risk_graph.png" alt="SPX Unbalanced Butterly - Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>The max loss here is the 5.00 - .15, or $485 per spread.</p>

<p>This will need to be price-discovered again on Monday. If the credit is still good, and if the SPX looks like it&rsquo;s going to be slowly grinding higher, I would put this trade on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Enjoy the weekend everyone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m expecting further upside in the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday after the ECB announcement, traders attempted to push the market lower but were unable to do so. We looked below balance, failed, made a poor low, and then came back into balance. Then this morning, we gapped up, but with the internals so strong, no chance of a gap fade play was available, and we continued to ratchet higher.</p>

<p>This is a very bullish signal, regardless of how overbought the conditions are. Here&rsquo;s the current SPX chart:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/spx_daily.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/spx_daily.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance, Range Extension" /></a></p>

<p>For those that took a bullish stance on the market during that time, congratulations. In the first SPX chart that I posted a couple of weeks back, I outlined the potential range extension we could see as possible target areas (via the pink rectangles). This week, not only did we break the 61.8% fib level, but we&rsquo;ve also broken the trendline resistance connected by the tops of November and December 2015. I believe we&rsquo;re headed to 2060. So if you&rsquo;re long, continue to hold that position.</p>

<p>Zooming out and taking a look at the market on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/spx_weekly.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/spx_weekly.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-11 Weekly Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance, Range Extension, Bottoming-Tail Hammer" /></a></p>

<p>Notice the bottoming tail hammer that formed. I count many weekly bars from before that ended with a higher close the following week.</p>

<p>The same bullishness can be seen in the Dow:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re approaching the trendline resistance here as well. Look for a short there. As a side note, DJX has also put in a bottoming-tail hammer on the weekly chart.</p>

<p>For the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>A little bit weaker here, as we have not tagged the 61.8% fib level, yet. Still, this has also put in a bottoming-tail hammer on the weekly chart.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03112016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Though it exhibited a lot of weakness a couple of days ago, keep in mind it has come off really high from the lows. It looks like it&rsquo;ll break that trendline resistance, and if it does, that&rsquo;ll suggest more short-covering to come.</p>

<p>That about wraps it up for the week going on to next week. I&rsquo;d just like to finish with another note:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not bullish on the market - I think the fundamentals are complete garbage, and I think we&rsquo;ll see a crash like we&rsquo;ve never seen before. However, I can&rsquo;t let my biases blind me from seeing the opportunities out there. Instead of falling prey to cognitive dissonance, we can separate our bias and take advantage of these opportunities as they come.</p>

<p>Enjoy the weekend, and good luck to everyone, bull or bear.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-10T19:09:16-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/10/short-term-traders-dominating</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market has been doing nothing other than balancing over the past 8 trading sessions. We&rsquo;re bracketing, and it&rsquo;s apparent that the market is being dominated by the shorter term traders looking to buy at the bottom of balance and sell at the top. We&rsquo;re unable to push prices higher, and today, we look below and failed. All of this price action over the past couple of weeks paints a very clear picture: traders have extremely low confidence.</p>

<p>While one can argue that the market seems bearish because Mario wasn&rsquo;t able to push prices higher with his market manipulation techniques, one can also argue that if we were truly bearish, we wouldn&rsquo;t have look outside below balance, and then come back in. We settled today at the point of control, which has just been getting more and more prominent over the past couple of weeks. Traders just like it here.</p>

<p>Today we formed a poor low in the /ES. Expect that to be repaired in the (possibly near) future.</p>

<p>/CL seems a bit confused about where it wants to go. We&rsquo;ve had back to back days that just completely engulfed the previous days, until today, when we closed on a Doji:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03102016/cl_f.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03102016/cl_f.png" alt="/CL - 2016-03-10 Daily Time Frame - Doji, Fibonacci" /></a></p>

<p>Crude looks like it wants to hit 40 or the 61.8% fib level. I&rsquo;ve set up the 39.5/40/40.5 balanced butterfly for a 0.30 debit.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck and happy trading in in the markets tomorrow.</p>

<p>TRIP continues to move to the downside. For those who shorted this from yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea, just trail your stop loss. We may get another bounce at around 60 (we got one today) before we head to the previous lows.</p>

<p>CMG gapped lower due to some news. For those who shorted this from yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea, just continue to trail your stop loss here as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03092016/cmg.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03092016/cmg.png" alt="CMG - 2016-03-09 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t know how much Draghi can do to rally the markets higher. In my opinion, whatever easing he&rsquo;s thinking of implementing is already priced in by the market. If he fails to deliver nothing more than a huge amount of money, the market will probably not take that as a good sign. Just saying. Whatever the case, be prepared.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today, have a safe trading day tomorrow.</p>

<p>SPX erases the past 3 days of trading:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>NDX continues to form lower Dojis:</p>

<p>DJX forms a swing high:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>RUT forms a swing high and had the biggest drop in % today.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>This could be the start of a new (down) trend, but given how nervous traders are out there, I would not be surprised if we gap up tomorrow; thus, monitor the markets for a continued move down.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of bearish trades that may pan out if the market continues to roll over:</p>

<p>/CL erased all of its gains from yesterday - this is quite bearish. Look for a break below 36. If sellers start coming in hard, then we&rsquo;ve got a &ldquo;look above and fail&rdquo; pattern, which would be a short signal. Keep a close eye on this.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/cl_f.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/cl_f.png" alt="/CL - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement and Harmonic Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>CMG exhibited a dark cloud cover pattern today, with a double top on the daily, and a small topping tail. The APR 600/610 call spread is currently trading for 0.97 cr.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png" alt="CMG - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Dark Cloud Cover, Double Top" /></a></p>

<p>TRIP has been a bit confused about where it wanted to go for the previous 4 days before today. Today&rsquo;s price action broke us out of a rising wedge. If bearishness continues, we can easily head to the lower 50s.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png" alt="TRIP - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Rising Wedge" /></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck in the markets tomorrow. Stay small, and stay safe.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/07/indices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The markets continue to grind higher, with the SPX closing today above the 61.8% fib level. The likely target is the descending trendline resistance, which should be around 2020:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Descending Trendline Resistance &amp; Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the DJX, it has also closed above the 61.8% fib level:
<a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Descending Trendline Resistance and Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, the strongest of them all, RUT, grinds higher:
<a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Ascending Trendline Support as Resistance and Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>And then, interestingly enough the NDX, which has been having a hard time getting some love:
<a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Whatever the case, it looks like the markets are mostly pointing to being neutral or moving higher. Unless the Bears have more confidence, this market will most likely continue to meander up here, dominated by many short term traders. Look for yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea on the market for ideas on trade location.</p>

<p>Moving over to /CL.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/cl_f.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03072016/cl_f.png" alt="/CL - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement and Harmonic Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>/CL is approaching its previous resistance levels, as well as the 50% fib level (Oct - Feb). Furthermore, a <a href="http://www.harmonictrader.com/price_patternsabcd.htm" title="harmonic pattern">harmonic pattern AB=CD</a> could be forming again (we saw one form from last May to last August, and a completion of the pattern from last October to last month). If we do see crude oil begin to roll over, we can initiate a short position, giving us a good trade location. However, for confirmation, I&rsquo;d like to see it trade below 35 again before shorting. For now, do keep an eye out on /CL.</p>

<p>For those that are a bit more aggressive, you may consider selling a call vertical here on /CL. The MAY 42/42.5 call spread (39 DTE) is trading for .15 cr currently, or the 42/43 call spread, currently trading for .28 cr.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today, happy trading out there, and enjoy the markets tomorrow.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/06/a-bullish-play-gold/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-06T17:05:56-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/06/a-bullish-play-gold</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Probably everyone and their mothers have already gotten the memo to buy Gold. I don&rsquo;t want to be jumping on the bandwagon because everyone else is, but because technical analysis points to further upside potential. Observe the chart of /GC below:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_out.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_out.png" alt="/GC" /></a></p>

<p>Gold has had a massive rally ever since the rounded bottom formed during the end of last year. On Feb 10-11 when the market double bottomed, we saw /GC put in a high, but even as the broad market rallied, /GC hasn&rsquo;t fallen much; instead, it consolidated and formed a wedge, and then towards the end of last week, it broke up and out of that wedge:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_in.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_in.png" alt="/GC" /></a></p>

<p>As such, we can expect this break out to continue to trend upwards. Any failure to maintain this new uptrend should be considered bearish, since that would be a classic &ldquo;look above and fail&rdquo; pattern.</p>

<p>For those that would like to take a theta-positive trade on this instrument, consider selling naked puts (perhaps at the 0.05 delta).</p>

<p>Another strategy that collects more premium but has upside risk is selling a strangle to finance a vertical debit call spread. One idea is to buy the 1300/1325 call spread, and finance it by selling the 1175/1375 strangle. This is currently trading for about 0.20 cr, so even after commissions, this trade can be put on for &ldquo;free.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the risk graph:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_risk_graph.png" alt="/GC" /></a></p>

<p>This trade has about a 71% probability of success, with the breakeven at 1400 to the upside (which lines up nicely with a previous horizontal resistance) and a bit below 1175 to the downside. Management is key here, as risk is unlimited - make sure to roll up/down and out in duration if the strikes are being threatened.</p>

<p>You can also consider legging into this position, if you believe that /GC will make a quick run up first. In that case, consider selling the naked put and buying the call spread, but leaving the naked call to be placed at a later time. Finding the right credit for these setups may be harder, but if you have the edge of technical analysis, you may not always need to place trades for a credit initially.</p>

<p>As always, stay small, and trade safely.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-06T09:16:35-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/06/market-outlook-will-the-short-squeeze-continue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past 6 weeks, the SPX has been rallying almost non-stop from the double-bottom lows. Last week, I wasn&rsquo;t convinced that we would see a follow through in the Bulls, but after the Bears failed to take this market lower on Monday, we only got more short squeeze action, and the Bulls remained in charge.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-06 Daily Timeframe Fibonaccis" /></a></p>

<p>Last Friday, SPX closed at the 61.8% fib retracement level. Will we continue to see a rally, or will we turn here? There are many factors leading me to think that the market will turn lower at this point - I&rsquo;ll first argue the Bear case:
1. The market has been extremely overextended to the upside, and almost every rally has been built on poor structure
2. The recent rallying has been closely tied to crude, and crude is coming up to major resistance levels
3. Friday&rsquo;s late day selloff was a bit unusual (usually on a short-squeezing day, we see the action continue all the way to the closing bell) and lends support to the fact that:
5. There is major overhead supply above us; path of least resistance is to the downside
6. Overall fundamentals have not changed</p>

<p>But, I&rsquo;ll also argue the other Bull case - we can continue to see higher prices:
1. Looking at the SPX chart above, a full extension of the W pattern goes as high as 2080 (though we may not see that target to be fully reached due to multiple trendline resistances along the way)
2. Though Friday&rsquo;s late day selloff was unusual, the longer term players usually don&rsquo;t wait until near the closing bell to sell a market
3. Liquidation breaks strengthen the market, and we had one on Friday morning
4. The RUT is the strongest out of all the indices and has not reached the 61.8% fib level (Dec - Feb). The NDX also closed above the 50% fib level (Dec - Feb), but has not reached the 61.8%</p>

<p>Although the edge is to the Bears here, any upside continuation may only cause more shorts to be nervous.</p>

<p>Looking at all the other major indices, the RUT is the strongest and doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;ll be pulling back, as the 61.8% fib level hasn&rsquo;t been reached, yet:
<a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-06 Daily Timeframe Fibonaccis" /></a></p>

<p>The NDX had balancing action over the past 3 trading days (2 hammers, 1 doji). It&rsquo;s currently sitting just a bit above the 50% fib level (Dec - Feb). A break out of balance to either side would most likely result in violent moves in that direction.
<a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-06 Daily Timeframe Fibonaccis" /></a></p>

<p>The DJX peaked above the 61.8% fib level, but closed underneath it:
<a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03062016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-06 Daily Timeframe Fibonaccis" /></a></p>

<p>With that, I&rsquo;ll leave you with a couple of trade ideas. These are mostly bearish plays, as is my current bias.</p>

<p>For a bearish play on the SPX: knowing that the peak of the extension from the W pattern is around 2080, we can place the APR 2080/2100 bear call spread (currently priced for about 3.00 cr). This trade has a 92% probability of success, and should be managed to avoid taking the max loss (consider rolling out in time for duration once the short strike is threatened). If the margin requirement on SPX is too much, consider the 208/210 bear call on the SPY - adjust the lot size as you see fit.</p>

<p>Another trade idea that is bearish, but also allows room for bullishness: we can sell the APR 206/208 call ratio spread on the SPY for about a 0.12 credit. If the market does in fact roll over, we win. But if not, and if it grinds higher and hovers around our 208 resistance area by expiration, even better. Our breakeven to the upside is 210.12, with a 93% win rate, and a max profit of 2.12 per spread. Adjust lot size as you see fit.</p>

<p>More direct, bullish plays here with credits are a bit hard to put on right now. IV is low, and any downmove will inflate our premium, which will most likely hurt us, so I caution against putting those on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this week&rsquo;s outlook. I&rsquo;ll be posting updates as the week progresses. Good luck, and happy trading.</p>
