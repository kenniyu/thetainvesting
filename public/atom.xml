    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market trucks relentlessly to the upside, and bias remains to the upside until market starts to show signs of sellers.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We closed just above that trendline, which can now be considered broken. The next target here is 2100, followed by 2115.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Bullish here as well. We closed above the highs of November from last year. The next target would be around 181.9.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>The weakest of the bunch, but it closed at the trendline resistance and has room to run to the upside. First target is the gap fill of 2016, which is just about 20 points away.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04182016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>This broke the trendline resistance very cleanly. The next major resistance is around 1200.</p>

<p>Today, we put on the trade discussed yesterday for the RUT - you can see that post <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish/" title="RUT Call Calendar Spread">here</a>.

    <updated>2016-04-17T12:37:47-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to remain cautiously bullish going into next week, given the massive overhead resistance we still have.</p>

<p>Looking at the broad market indices on the weekly, here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We finished last week with a wide body candle after <em>consolidating</em> for a couple of weeks prior. This leads me to believe that, if we do continue moving up, the trendline resistance up ahead is less likely to hold, given how close we consolidated just under that.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>The previous trendline resistance (now support) is holding up nicely. The same thing can be seen here - consolidation right underneath the 100% Fib level from back in November. This makes me think it&rsquo;s not hard to pierce that resistance level.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Again, same thing.</p>

<p>The RUT probably paints the clearest picture:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve consolidated over the past two weeks below the trendline and closed the week right up against it. That trendline can easily be invalidated, in which case we&rsquo;d have clearance to run up to the 1200 levels again.</p>

<p>Given what we just saw in the RUT, come Monday I&rsquo;m looking to put on a Call Calendar (again?!) in the RUT (unfortunately, the market has been extremely boring recently, and this is one of the bread and butter strategies during times of low volatility):</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/rut_call_calendar.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04172016/rut_call_calendar.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-17 - Call Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll manage this over the next month. The debit here is quite small for the potential gains we can achieve. If you have a bearish portfolio, this could be quite beneficial if the market does continue running higher.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this weekend. I&rsquo;ll be posting that trade, along with all other entries/adjustments, live on Twitter, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get all of my updates in real time.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/14/value-building-higher/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-14T21:38:50-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/14/value-building-higher</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market remains strong as value builds higher:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/esm6.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-14 - Market Profile - 20d Zoomed In" /></a></p>

<p>We were able to hold above the balance area for the second trading session after the breakout. Stay with the trend, and that is up. Any kind of a pullback on not-so-bearish internals can be considered buy points, as short term traders are still the most dominant traders out there in terms of price action. 2067 would be that point.</p>

<p>We are at some very interesting points in the broad market indices, so just wanted to briefly present them.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-14 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re just about 10 points away from 2092 on the SPX, which would be the trendline resistance point by tomorrow. As mentioned yesterday, we expected a consolidation day today, and that is exactly what we got today, that Doji. Watch for either a continuation or a reversal tomorrow.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-14 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>We just barely tagged the high from back in November, closing on a spinning top. Again, watch for a continuation or a reversal tomorrow.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-14 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Very similar here as it&rsquo;s also closing today on a Doji like the SPX after tagging that trendline resistance.</p>

<p>And the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04142016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-14 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Touching that trendline resistance today and closing on a spinning top.</p>

<p>These are all very similar patterns across all the indices, so we shall see how this all plays out tomorrow.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. I&rsquo;ll keep posting new entries/adjustments on Twitter, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get all of my updates in real time.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/13/breaking-out-of-balance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market broke out of balance very clearly today to the upside as we mentioned yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04132016/esm6.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04132016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-13 - Market Profile - 15d Zoomed In" /></a></p>

<p>We attempted to trade back below balance, but failed as buyers kept the market up.</p>

<p>On the SPX, we now have clearance to tag the uppermost trendline resistance this Friday at around 2090.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04132016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04132016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-13 - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Also, from now on for the SPX chart, the pink rectangles will be removed - the target here has been reached.</p>

<p>Watch for the top of the balance area to hold as support, because we can just as easily fail tomorrow and fall back into the balance area, which is not a strong Bullish signal. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll be looking for a rotation all the way back down to the bottom of the balance area (2012) as a weekly play. However, tomorrow, I&rsquo;m looking for some consolidation before any moves higher.</p>

<p>One of the plays that I&rsquo;m looking at currently is the SPY MAY2/APR5 211/210 Diagonal Call spread, currently going for about .26 debit:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04132016/spy_call_diagonal.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04132016/spy_call_diagonal.png" alt="SPY Diagonal Call Spread - 2016-04-13 - Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>This has breakevens at around 206 and 212 over the next few weeks. Given the low volatility that we&rsquo;ve been having and the low confidence in any downmove, as long as we stay in this range, we should be good to milk some premium. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put this on tomorrow.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still inside the large balance area between 2012.25 and 2067. From the movement today, it appears we&rsquo;ll reach the upper side of the balance area tomorrow, and we&rsquo;ll need to pay close attention to the strength of the breakout to the upside from there. Keep in mind 2067 was the overnight high that was had not revisited yet. Intraday tomorrow, we may see multiple touches of this level, and multiple backing-offs. If we do see this kind of action, be prepared for an even stronger breakout.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/11/still-in-balance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had another late-day selloff. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if we gap up tomorrow morning as we have been doing so much these past couple of weeks.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04112016/esm6_15d.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04112016/esm6_15d.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-11 - Market Profile - 15d" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still trading within the balance area between 2012.25 and 2067, so things still look neutral to me. The next, intermediate downside reference point is 2026. If we can build value near that area (remember 2025 is the POC from the Janet Yellen day - this is the day with the three blue distributions), then I&rsquo;d give the edge to the Bears. Until then, bias remains neutral, but be ready because those reference points below us are weak, as can be seen in the 20-day chart:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04112016/esm6_20d.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04112016/esm6_20d.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-11 - Market Profile - 20d - Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

    <updated>2016-04-09T13:26:26-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/09/preparing-for-a-breakout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This market has been consolidating in a big balance area for a while now, with the volume POC for the past 15 days at around the 2040.75 level in the /ES:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/esm6.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-09 - Market Profile" /></a></p>

<p>The composite doesn&rsquo;t look quite skewed in any direction, so I would say we&rsquo;re right in the middle of this entire balance area between 2012 and 2067.</p>

<p>Keep in mind 2012 goes back to a spike high from March 16 (refer to <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/" title="Weak Reference Points">this post for more info</a> ), as well as a <em>close</em> touch of that point back in March 24. Keep this weak reference point in mind going forward.</p>

<p>Short term traders continue to be the dominant players here, getting themselves overly long or overly short. Until we see some bigger players come into play and break us out of balance, assume that we trade within the denoted range.</p>

<p>Overall, momentum in the board market indices does look like it is slowing and rounding off. My bias here is still neutral, and with such low IV, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be selling premium. If you have a directional bias and you&rsquo;re bearish, selling calls might not be a bad idea. Personally, I&rsquo;d want to be buying cheap OOM calendar spreads.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t really traded options on the indices in a while, but here&rsquo;s a trade idea on the SPY utilizing an OOM put calendar:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/spy_put_calendar.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/spy_put_calendar.png" alt="SPY - 2016-04-09 - Put Calendar Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like SPY to trade between 190 and 202 by expiration. Adjust strikes as necessary. If you want to collect a credit, you can think about moving the nearer term strike higher.</p>

<p>A simple call credit spread on the SPY is also not a bad idea. I may be looking to put some on this coming week, depending on conditions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about a Bullish play on AMZN:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/amzn.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/amzn.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-04-09 - Daily - Sitting at Horizontal Support" /></a></p>

<p>AMZN is holding up at the horizontal support level and the upward trendline support level. One of the things I&rsquo;m looking to do is put on a call condor on AMZN that includes the earnings cycle, obviously as an earnings play. I&rsquo;ll also be looking to finance this condor by selling put spreads beneath trendline support for the weeks prior to earnings, as long as the market continues to stay in balance. The reason I&rsquo;m thinking about putting on this trade is that if the market does continue to stay in balance or climb higher, AMZN usually won&rsquo;t sell off and may even climb higher as well into earnings.</p>

<p>Currently the APR5 660/670/690/700 call condor is being priced in for about .89 debit:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/amzn_call_condor.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04092016/amzn_call_condor.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-04-09 - Call Condor Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>I might buy a few of these. These and the put spreads will need to be managed if AMZN starts to lose the support levels.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on these trades come Monday, so <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates.

    <updated>2016-04-07T22:19:22-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/07/shifting-bias-to-neutral</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Short term traders still remain in control.</p>

<p>The price action has been volatile and we&rsquo;ve been having 100% retracements within very short periods of time - i.e. swings from one side of the lows to the highs the very next day. Just two days ago, shorts who tried to push the market lower by the end of the trading session got punished the very next day by the Bulls who took the market all the way up to the highs yesterday. Now, today we&rsquo;ve just reversed all of that and traded even lower today. There&rsquo;s no doubt that shorter term traders are in control here.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04072016/esm6_vp.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04072016/esm6_vp.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-07 - Market Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s action touched yesterday&rsquo;s point of control early in the session before failing there, and for the rest of the day, traders built value lower to almost not overlapping. We even took out the weak reference point of 2033.5 and tagged the point of control going back to the Fed day shown by the 3 blue distribution areas on the left side. By the end of today&rsquo;s session, the POC migrated lower to near Apr 5th&rsquo;s POC.</p>

<p>Today was a very interesting day and it appears that the sellers are finally getting some control. Instead of being bought up after gapping down this morning, we actually continued selling and sentiment remained bearish all day.</p>

<p>Zooming out over the past 20 days, here is the volume profile:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04072016/esm6.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04072016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-07 - Market Profile Zoomed Out" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the reference points to watch out for tomorrow (and this is important due to the short term traders dominating):</p>

<p><strong>Settlement</strong>: 2034.75<br/>
<strong>POC</strong>: 2040<br/>
<strong>Value area high</strong>: 2043<br/>
<strong>Value area low</strong>: 2029.75<br/></p>

<p>Tomorrow, if we gap up, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be watching for:</p>

<ol>
<li>How far of a gap are we gapping up by? Anything around double digits is going to be a hard gap to fade unless internals are very bearish. If internals do show strong bearishness, I would look to target the POC and then after that, the settlement, then the value area low, then today&rsquo;s low (2026), then low of the Fed day (2019), then 2012 (the unvisited high of the March 16 spike). Watch for a bounce at any of these levels and look at internals for confirmation.</li>
<li>Are we opening up inside of value area? If so, observe how traders behave - do they want to take it outside of value area and explore higher, lower, or just keep it near the POC? Again, if internals aren&rsquo;t confirming a strong move up or down, then the value area high is most likely a short, and the value area low is most likely a buy. This is just responsive trading. If internals are strong enough for us to break out of value area, then a break below value area is a short, and a break above would be a buy.</li>
<li>How far of a gap down are we gapping down by? Anything around double digits is going to be a hard gap to fade unless internals are very bullish. If internals do show strong bullishness, and we try to go lower but fail and instead we take out the overnight low, I would look to target the yesterday&rsquo;s low and then after that, the value area low, the settlement, then the POC and then value area high, and then from there, yesterday&rsquo;s POC at around 2050. Watch any of these levels for a potential short as well, and watch the internals for confirmation.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. I don&rsquo;t have trade setups for tonight, but if you <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>, you will be able to see every trade that I enter, adjust, and exit, and my live market commentary.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/06/more-consolidation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market continues to consolidate here. As I mentioned yesterday, I just didn&rsquo;t see enough sellers, and that spells low confidence.</p>

<p>Looking at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Look-Above-And-Fail" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s look-above-and-fail pattern failed, and now we&rsquo;re back up above the trendline support. All of this just spells low confidence.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Bounced off Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t continue lower after testing the support. Once again, consolidating just above the trendline support.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Seller Shutoff" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still consolidating here, though we have a wide body candle.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04062016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Bullish Engulfing" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now back up above the 61.8% Fib level - again, this spells low confidence. When a price level is traded through many times, it&rsquo;s not a sign of trend confidence, but rather a sign of consolidation, or low confidence.</p>

<p>Today, we put on a couple of new trades, specifically calendar spreads in CMG and EEM. We also made some adjustments to our TSLA position (currently our worst trade so far) and closed out our AAPL calendar (at a profit). Check them out in the <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/trades" title="Ongoing Trades">Trades</a> page.

    <updated>2016-04-05T21:23:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/05/market-still-pausing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There isn&rsquo;t a lot pointing to the Bears being in full control, yet. For now, it still appears to just be consolidation. I am still watching for a break below 2033.5 on the /ES with strong follow-through before I turn bearish.</p>

<p>Looking at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Look-Above-And-Fail" /></a></p>

<p>Today it appears we formed a look-above-and-fail pattern - I&rsquo;d like to see follow-through to the downside for confirmation.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Sitting at Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>We closed just at trendline support. Let&rsquo;s see if it holds.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>This appears to just be consolidating over the past 5 trading days.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now below the 61.8% Fib level. We&rsquo;ve now traded near and around the 61.8% Fib level many times - consolidation is still happening here.</p>

<p>Ok - we haven&rsquo;t been putting on many trades this week. This is largely due to my reluctance to sell premium in a cycle that contains earnings, but I&rsquo;ve managed to find some that avoid it with good weeklies.</p>

<p>I wanted to go back to GS which I mentioned the other day:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs_batman.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs_batman.png" alt="GS - 2016-04-05 - Put Backratio With Call Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>Though this play contains an earnings cycle, I&rsquo;ve noticed that it doesn&rsquo;t quite move much from earnings reports. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind putting this on tomorrow - with pretty wide breakevens, we can aim for a move towards both ends of the spectrum, regardless of which way the market moves. Just as long as it doesn&rsquo;t crash, of course. This is currently being priced in at a .67 cr.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also got a couple of calendars/diagonals for play here.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s DIS:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/dis.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/dis.png" alt="DIS - 2016-04-05 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Aiming for 90 by the 4th week of April:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/dis_diagonal.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/dis_diagonal.png" alt="DIS - 2016-04-05 - Diagonal Put" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s EEM:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/eem.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/eem.png" alt="EEM - 2016-04-05 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Aiming for 30 by the 5th week of April:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/eem_calendar.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/eem_calendar.png" alt="EEM - 2016-04-05 - Put Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s CMG:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/cmg.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/cmg.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Slow Grind to 420" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a slow grind down to 420:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/cmg_calendar.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04052016/cmg_calendar.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-05 - Put Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>All of these require a debit, but when volatility is low, these are good deals. If we get the directional move we want and volatility expands and time decays the nearer-term option, the spread can really expand nicely.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. I&rsquo;ll most likely be putting these trades on, so <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates.

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/04/monitoring-for-continuation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today&rsquo;s action is just balancing after a trending move. For me to consider this bearish, I&rsquo;d want to see 2033.5 on the /ES get taken out. I&rsquo;d like to see value move lower as well. Also, the highs from the overnight session usually don&rsquo;t mark the end of up-moves, so expect 2071.5 to be revisited sometime soon, and if it doesn&rsquo;t, carry that information forward.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-04 - Daily - Consolidation Above Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for this to hold up at the trendline support. A failure to remain above it is an edge to the Bears.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-04 - Daily - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking for this to hold up at the trendline support.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-04 - Daily - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>Looks like a pause before a continuation higher.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-04 - Daily - 61.8% Fib Level" /></a></p>

<p>This is a bit more interesting. Still holding above the 61.8 Fib level and may just slowly grind around here until it touches the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>For those looking for a bearish play, I&rsquo;ve been looking at CMG. We have a trendline support coming up on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/cmg_weekly.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/cmg_weekly.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-04 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>As well as a revisit of the prior lows at 400 on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/cmg.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/cmg.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-04 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to place a small butterfly to capture a move down into the 400 area:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/cmg_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04042016/cmg_risk_graph.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-04 - Risk Graph" /></a></p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/03/potential-upside-plays/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-03T21:34:10-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/03/potential-upside-plays</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at a couple of trade setups given the bullish follow-through I&rsquo;m expecting this coming week and the lack of bearishness out there.</p>

<p>First is GS:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs.png" alt="GS - 2016-04-03 - Daily - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve currently put in a rounded-bottom / inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, and on Friday it appears that we&rsquo;re just breaking out of that right shoulder. If we continue to see bullishness, GS has room to run up to the trendline resistance. This should bring us to about 177 by the time of their earnings. As I&rsquo;m expecting a short term run up, this could make for a (slightly aggressive) potential options play:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs_risk_reversal.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs_risk_reversal.png" alt="GS - 2016-04-03 - Bull Call Spread Financed by Put Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll buy a slightly OOM call vertical and finance it by selling a put backratio with 11 days to go. We&rsquo;re currently getting a credit for this, but of course this will have to be priced again on Monday.</p>

<p>For those that are a bit more conservative and would like more room for error in case we do have a downside move, consider a longer term play that <em>includes</em> the earnings cycle:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs_batman.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/gs_batman.png" alt="GS - 2016-04-03 - Put Backratio With Call Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>Your range of profit potential is wide, with the peaks denoting the max profits (about $500 per spread). With pretty wide breakevens, and the fact that GS doesn&rsquo;t usually move much from earnings, this is a safer approach that could help you profit from either a move up to the 175 area which is near the trendline resistance, or down to the 140 area which is near prior support levels. I personally like this trade more, as we have duration to help us out, too, in case we&rsquo;re wrong on direction.</p>

<p>Another idea is the SPY:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/spy_diagonal.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04032016/spy_diagonal.png" alt="SPY - 2016-04-03 - Diagonal Call Spread" /></a></p>

<p>This is not a short term trade, but one that has a wide breakeven as well by expiration. If you don&rsquo;t expect the SPY to move past 211 by the next few weeks, or if you expect it to slowly grind higher, a cheap diagonal here could be the play.</p>

<p>These are just a couple of ideas that I&rsquo;m looking to put on for Monday - they may be adjusted slightly depending on how the market opens on Monday and where things are priced. I will tweet out the exact trade that I put on in real time, though. Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> and turn on notifications from me to get my posts in real time (no I don&rsquo;t post pictures of cats or food - no spam, just trades only).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now - good luck, and let&rsquo;s have another week of good trading.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/02/bullish-into-next-week/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-02T11:29:57-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/02/bullish-into-next-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m certain the markets will continue to climb higher next week.</p>

<p>There are just not enough sellers out there. On Friday, we were able to enter into the second distribution area from the Janet Yellen day:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/es.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-02 - Weak Sellers Failing to Take Market Lower Regardless of Poor Structure" /></a></p>

<p>But before spending enough time there, we couldn&rsquo;t find more sellers to come in. What I was expecting to happen when we broke into the second distribution area was that we at least test the 2033.5 level (and it should be relatively easy to get there due to the extremely poor structure). Obviously that didn&rsquo;t happen, and instead, on Friday during RTH, we ended up moving back up over the overnight low and through the open (which was a strong buy signal). Overnight shorts did not get paid, got nervous, and we saw the market run higher for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Is that bearish? No. Sellers are extremely nervous out there still, and looking at the tape, every time they tried to take this market lower, they completely failed, even when structurally it was easy for them to do so. So regardless of how overbought this market is right now, we should be thinking bullish into next week. We&rsquo;ll have some trade ideas presented later this weekend based around this bullish bias, but first:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/spx_daily.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/spx_daily.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-02 - Daily - Bullish - Trendline Resistance Becomes Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how we tried to break down, but ended up finding support at what was previously the trendline resistance. A classic look below and fail pattern - <strong>pretty bullish</strong>. First target here is the top of the range extension denoted by the top right pink box, which is around 2084, followed by the next trendline resistance at around 2090, and then the even 2100.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/spx_weekly.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/spx_weekly.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>Strong momentum.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly - Breaking Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Again, strong momentum. It actually broke through the trendline resistance. Target here would be 180.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly - 61.8% Fib Level Acts as Support" /></a></p>

<p>It found support off that 61.8% Fib level. Next target is that trendline resistance.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/04022016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-02 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>Which looks like it may just plow through that trendline resistance, and if so, the next target would be back up to 1200.</p>

<p>Given the doubt that many have on how much higher this market can really run, but keeping in mind the bullish targets explained just above, I have a few options trade ideas that may work well just for this scenario. This will be done in a separate post which I will tweet out later this weekend, so stay tuned, and <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me</a> if you haven&rsquo;t already so that you&rsquo;ll know about it right when I tweet it out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not a lot of updates for today. For tomorrow, keep in mind the reference points pointed out a couple of days ago (those that separate the distributions):</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03312016/es.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03312016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-31 - Three Separate Distributions - Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve denoted them by the dashed blue horizontal price levels. Also keep in mind the unemployment rate and non-farm employment change data coming out tomorrow at 8:30 am EST. Those could potentially be market movers and may entice more buyers/sellers to come in.</p>

<p>I think this market has been waiting for a move lower, so if we break lower, watch for volume. That will be an indicator of if sellers are still weak out there, or if they&rsquo;re coming in strong.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all the updates for today.</p>

<p>Also, no trade ideas planned, but I may be posting new trades live on Twitter tomorrow as I do every day, so you should be <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">following me</a> to get my updates in real-time.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/es.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-30 15m Time Frame - Multiple Distributions - Gap Higher" /></a></p>

<p>Towards the beginning of today&rsquo;s session we saw a liquidation break which looked like it was going to fill the overnight gap on the /ES - that is what should&rsquo;ve happened if the Bears were really here. Unfortunately for them, all we had was a slow grind lower, which wasn&rsquo;t a convincing move (I <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/715222086789111808" title="Slow Grind Lower Tweet">tweeted this out</a> as we were gradually trading lower). Not only did we snap higher, but by the end of the day, we weren&rsquo;t able to even fill the gap on the /ES.</p>

<p>What the Bears needed today was a gap down to the lowest distribution (denoted by the bottom-most blue rectangle) and build value there - that would&rsquo;ve signified a more bearish signal. Instead, not only did we <strong>not</strong> trade in the middle or top-most distribution, but price actually gapped above and traders accepted prices up at where we currently are. That&rsquo;s quite a bullish signal. On weak structure, of course. But again, don&rsquo;t fight price.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Breached" /></a></p>

<p>Our 2060 target was reached. That trendline resistance has been broken, and is now meaningless. The next target would now be around 2095.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Breached" /></a></p>

<p>This closed above the trendline resistance, also rendering it useless.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>This is still on track to touching the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03302016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Doji Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>Closing above the 61.8% Fib level on a Doji (consolidation). This was actually quite weak today. The trendline resistance could be tagged, so look to see if we continue or reverse tomorrow.</p>

<p>By the way, that put backratio that we put on for LNKD yesterday turned out great today. For those of you who are in this trade, if you want to turn this into a 100% winner, 0% risk trade, buy the 98 put to turn the backratio into a balanced butterfly (this put option costs less than the credit we received when we put this trade on). Your max profit is reduced by the cost of this additional put that you buy, and regardless of where LNKD moves, this trade is an absolute winner.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market continues to rally on poor structure. Today after Yellen&rsquo;s speech, the /ES created three distributions, separated by single print spikes:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/es.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-29 - Three Separate Distributions" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve highlighted the distribution areas in blue. These single prints tend to act as levels for bounce plays, especially when the market is dominated by mostly short-term traders. For tomorrow, keep these weak reference points in mind. These are 2043.50 and 2033.50.</p>

<p>Here are the broad market indices:</p>

<p>SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>This will most likely reach our 2060 target.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>A retest of the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>This is well on its way to the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03292016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame" /></a></p>

<p>Closing above the 61.8% Fib level.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with one trade idea for tomorrow. We&rsquo;ve been putting on quite some trades, so its wise we have time each day to manage each as necessary (though not a lot of management has been necessary so far for many of our trades).</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a trade idea on LNKD:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png" alt="LNKD - 2016-03-28 Range-Bound" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m expecting for the stock to slowly grind lower or meander in between the 100 to 125 price range. If it does manage to get down to 100, I&rsquo;m expecting a bounce to occur, as it has been a while since we&rsquo;ve tested that prior support level. Because of these reasons, I think a put backratio would allow us to capture profits on a slow move down, as well as any moves up. Here is the 105/102 put backratio in APR:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03282016/lnkd_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03282016/lnkd_risk_graph.png" alt="LNKD Risk Graph - 2016-03-28 Put Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>We have big downside risk, so management is key here. We may be able to turn this into a cheap butterfly later as well, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to receive my trade entries and adjustments in real time.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-26T17:38:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/26/bias-remains-to-the-upside-currently</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember this chart from last Friday?</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/esm6_thurs_fri.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03182016/esm6_thurs_fri.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Single Prints Separating Distributions as Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>If you missed the explanation of what these reference points mean, <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/" title="/ES Weak Reference Points">please take a look</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to Thursday&rsquo;s action, I was thinking that perhaps this could be the turning point for the Bears to step in and take the market back lower. However, from Thursday&rsquo;s action:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/es_f.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/es_f.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Bias Continues to Upside" /></a></p>

<p>We came close to the 2012 level, and instead of taking out that weak reference point, we bounced off hard and the Bulls took the market back up to fill the gap between Wednesday and Thursday. So the way we edge lower has me thinking that we will test 2060 soon on the SPX and possibly take that out and move higher to about 2090.</p>

<p>At the same time, value built lower on Thursday because most of the time was spent trading around 2016 on the /ES. And while we did finish the day filling the gap, late day rallies (and selloffs) are usually suspect and unsustainable. So Bulls, don&rsquo;t get too excited here. Keep value in mind, and don&rsquo;t be fooled by price (don&rsquo;t fight it, either).</p>

<p>Shorter term time frame traders are still dominating here, and structure remains weak. The only way the edge will shift to the Bears is if we take out that 2012 level (basically Thursday&rsquo;s low). After that, look for the next weak low at 1995 to be taken out.</p>

<p>Until then, bias still remains to the upside.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I believe the 2060 target is not out of play and may be reached soon. Looking at the other indices, I think we may consolidate there more before moving higher, which makes for a possible trade here which I&rsquo;ll show below.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/djx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>Same comment as the SPX.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/ndx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>Still under the 61.8% fib level, which doesn&rsquo;t mean much as a resistance level given how much we&rsquo;ve traded back and forth between this level.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>The 61.8 fib level is still in play here as resistance.</p>

<p>Ok, trade ideas:</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m looking for the SPX to head to 2060 and stall there a bit, here&rsquo;s the play:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/spx_diagonal.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/spx_diagonal.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 - Diagonal Call Spread" /></a></p>

<p>We front some debit here, and will incur losses if SPX blows through the 2060 very quickly, so this will need to be managed if that happens (keep a close eye on this and my Twitter). We want SPX to expire near our short strike by its expiration. Now this will have to be priced in again on Monday and will depend on how the futures trade Sunday night. I&rsquo;ll tweet this trade out if I end up putting it on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking at AMZN:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/amzn.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/amzn.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Range Extension - 61.8% Fibonnaci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Last week we put a trade on for AMZN that would take advantage of a slow grind down to prior support levels at around 475. After doing so, we got faked out when the 547 support broke, and for the rest of the week, AMZN grinded higher. This is great for our position, as we had put it on for a credit, so the further it&rsquo;s away from our unbalanced butterfly, the higher the probability that we win on this trade (of course, we would like AMZN to trade near our short strikes for max profit, but a winner is a winner).</p>

<p>This week, I&rsquo;m looking for upside follow-through in this stock. Notice how the 50% fib level acts as the resistance level. If we pierce through this, and if the market does indeed turn around and move higher, I think we at least head to the 61.8 fib level and possibly double the range of the consolidation area that we&rsquo;ve had since February (between 547 and 585, ~ 35 points) and head to 620. Of course, because we&rsquo;ve retraced a long way from the 547 lows, the best way to hit 620 would be for AMZN to make a slight pullback before breaking the 50% fib level. Keep that point in mind, because we&rsquo;ll use that information to manage our trade. So here&rsquo;s the trade I&rsquo;m thinking:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/amzn_condor.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/amzn_condor.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-26 Risk Graph - Condor" /></a></p>

<p>We can place a condor with a slight debit (.92 currently) with 1 week to go. If AMZN is able to reach the 61.8% fib level and close around there, we&rsquo;ll collect the max profit of 9.05. We should be looking to manage this trade by looking at the market action, in case we get a look above and fail. I&rsquo;ll also tweet out this trade when I end up putting it on, so keep watch.</p>

<p>Another one is EWZ:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/ewz.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/ewz.png" alt="EWZ - 2016-03-26 Support and Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to sell a strangle here in May - not sure why the implied volatility here is pretty rich. But I also have a bearish bias on this, so I&rsquo;m looking to buy a put spread as well. Here is the trade:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/ewz_strangle_put_vertical.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03262016/ewz_strangle_put_vertical.png" alt="EWZ - 2016-03-26 Strangle and Put Vertical" /></a></p>

<p>Breakevens are at around 19.1 and 30.9. We can put this on for about a .84 cr.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck in the markets. Remember to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> as that is where I&rsquo;ll be posting my trades up in real-time.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-23T17:47:43-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/23/an-edge-to-the-bears</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finally saw a bone thrown to the Bears camp. When traders accepted prices below the value area today, that was a bearish signal. All of this could change, but this is definitely an edge to the Bears.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>From a candlestick pattern analysis, on the SPX, we formed a Doji yesterday and traded below that. This is once again negative on the year, so watch for continuation here. 2060 could still be the target until we see more downside.</p>

<p>The DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>We fell back from tagging that trendline resistance mentioned a couple of days ago - we may be starting to pick up momentum, so similar to the SPX, watch for continuation as well.</p>

<p>The NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Trading Below 61.% Fibonacci Retracement Level" /></a></p>

<p>As it has been recently, it was the weakest of the bunch, closing today below the 200 DMA and trading right below the 61.8% fib.</p>

<p>The RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level - Look Above and Fail" /></a></p>

<p>The look-above-and-fail pattern confirmed today and we took out all the gains, now sitting at the 50% fib. Also monitor for continuation to the downside here.</p>

<p>Essentially, all indices pointing down, and in my opinion, we should continue to see lower prices.</p>

<p>No management is necessary for all current and existing trades. These have been added to the <a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/trades" title="Trades">Trades page</a>, with risk graphs shown. I try to keep the risk graphs up-to-date as often as possible.</p>

<p>With that, I&rsquo;ll leave us once again with just one trade idea for tomorrow - FXI:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png" alt="FXI - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Fade China" /></a></p>

<p>We had a nice pop from last week, and a nice rally for a whole month now. I think a fade play here would be nice. Something like selling the APR 34 call and buying the 32/31 put vertical. I&rsquo;ll tweet out the trade.</p>

<p>Remember that the markets are closed on Friday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market stalls here.</p>

<p>We had the SPX close today on a Doji - this doesn&rsquo;t mean a reversal is coming, it just means indecision, or consolidation, before a break out higher or lower. The longer we consolidate, the more forceful the breakout, so do keep that in mind. Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/spx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>We actually peeked above the consolidation area not once, but twice, since yesterday. While that may seem bearish, keep in mind we did the same look-below-and-fail today. So still, trade is being dominated by short-term traders.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/djx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Tag" /></a></p>

<p>It actually tagged that trendline resistance and fell back a bit, which was what we expected. If the markets continue to exhibit weakness tomorrow, I&rsquo;m considering the APR5 177.5/180 call spread going for .98 cr right now.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Grinding Higher" /></a></p>

<p>It actually continued higher today and was the strongest of the bunch. Not surprising here as it was the laggard for most of the huge rally that the SPX had.</p>

<p>And the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/rut.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday we were looking for either a follow through higher from possibly a bounce off of the trendline support, but we did not get that. Earlier during today&rsquo;s session, it appeared that yesterday&rsquo;s session was nothing but a look-above-and-fail, but by the end of today, we didn&rsquo;t have a look-below-and-fail, either. Again, indecision here, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Overall, the indices spell very mixed signals. On one hand, you have the NDX up and the DJX down, but both SPX and RUT aren&rsquo;t sure where to go. The longer the market stays in a tight consolidation range, the more explosive the breakout. Stay aware.</p>

<p>Today we got filled on three trades:</p>

<p>Potential trades for tomorrow:</p>

<p>Earlier today I was looking at PCLN as a potential candidate for a balanced butterfly, centered around the 1300 level. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png" alt="PCLN - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Channel Support" /></a></p>

<p>There is an ascending trendline support which should end up at around 1300 by this Thursday. In the event of a slight downdraft in the markets, we may be able to find support here. There&rsquo;s also a rising channel support going back to the gap up from earnings. This should help the 1300 level act as a support as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/pcln_risk_graph.png" alt="PCLN Risk Graph - 2016-03-22 - Balanced Butterfly" /></a></p>

<p>The 1310/1300/1290 butterfly is currently being priced for about .80 db. I&rsquo;ll be trying to lowball this for about .50.</p>

<p>And for DIA:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia.png" alt="DIA - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Short &amp; Long Strikes" /></a></p>

<p>In the market recap before, I mentioned that if the market exhibits weakness and we see all indices drop, a 177.5/180 call vertical on DIA would not be a bad idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png" alt="DIA Risk Graoh - 2016-03-22 - Vertical Credit Call Spread" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s currently being priced at about 1.01 cr for the spread expiring on APR5, but depending on when the fill happens and how much the market drops, it&rsquo;ll be lower.</p>

<p>Another trade idea here is GDX:</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png" alt="GDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a bit of a pullback from this big run that we&rsquo;ve had. As GDX stalls here, I&rsquo;m hoping to collect some premium on the call side, possibly the APR 21.5 naked call, and I&rsquo;m also looking to add a more bearish bias, as we&rsquo;re at the top of this channel resistance. To that effect, I&rsquo;m considering buying the 20/19 put spread, also in APR. Together, this should bring in about .22 cr.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx_risk_graph.png"><img src="http://kenniyu.github.io/images/blog/03222016/gdx_risk_graph.png" alt="GDX Risk Graph - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation" /></a></p>
