    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p>One of the things that we love most about stocks is trading them in the direction of the trend, at an area of value. By area of value, we mean at places like retracements. One particular stock that shows this is $FCX. Check out the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png" alt="$FCX - 2017-02-26 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 200MA, FCX provides a good long entry at 13.25. As this stock tends to overshoot past the 200MA, one can consider entering a bit beneath it as well. However, the stop placement should take that into consideration as well and be placed well below it. Though a further stop reduces the size of the position one can place, it also allows us to ride the trend longer. If anything, we can always add to the position on another pullback if $FCX does continue higher.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>One stock that makes a good long candidate is $RIG, as it just reclaimed the 50MA and is above the 200MA. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170223/rig.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170223/rig.png" alt="$RIG - 2017-02-23 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Entry would be around 14.23, and stop would be placed outside the average noise, below the 200MA at around 12.01. As always, remember to always trade with the trend, and ride it for as long as possible.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/16/fireworks-for-swks/"/>

    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/16/fireworks-for-swks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>We particularly like to look for stocks that are currently consolidating with a potential of moving higher with the trend of the market. One particular candidate to put on our watchlist is $SWKS. Please observe the chart below</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170216/swks.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170216/swks.png" alt="$SWKS - 2017-02-16 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>$SWKS has exploded like a firework after earnings and has recently consolidated around the 92 level. As the 20MA catches up, we&rsquo;re looking for buyers to step in and hold price above that curve. We&rsquo;re looking for another set of fireworks - a breakout above 94. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to start accumulating some long deltas. For stock, we&rsquo;ll be going long at 91.80 with a stop below the 20MA at 87.46.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/16/duk-reclaims-200ma/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-16T17:37:16-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/16/duk-reclaims-200ma</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>The utility sector in general has been hanging out in an area of value for one to get long. One stock in this sector in particular which just reported earnings is DUK. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170216/duk.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170216/duk.png" alt="$DUK - 2017-02-16 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With earnings out of the way, and with it reclaiming the 20, 50, and 200MA via a strong close, $DUK looks like it&rsquo;s positioned for another run up. We&rsquo;ll look to buy if price crosses above 78.90, with a stop at 75.79 to give us some leeway to account for recent noise. As long as price holds and trends upward, we&rsquo;ll continue to hold.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/15/pcln-revisited/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-15T19:07:36-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/15/pcln-revisited</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re currently looking at two potential bullish plays.</p>

<p>First is $PCLN:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170215/pcln.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170215/pcln.png" alt="$PCLN - 2017-02-15 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>We had mentioned to get long <a href="/blog/2017/01/23/long-pcln/" title="Long PCLN">back on Jan 23</a>, and $PCLN has trended nicely since then. However, with the recent three day consolidation, and the bullishness of the market, $PCLN looks ready to break out higher for more upside gains. One can look to add more on a break above 1652.</p>

<p>Second is $TXN:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170215/txn.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170215/txn.png" alt="$TXN - 2017-02-15 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>$TXN has also trended nicely over the past year, holding above the 50MA. We&rsquo;ve pulled back to it recently, making it a great location to get long. We&rsquo;re looking to get long above 75.76, with a stop at 72.20. We&rsquo;ll continue staying long as long as trend holds.</p>
