    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that the overall trend of the equities market is up. As such, many stocks are simply following the trend, and so should we. We&rsquo;ve been looking at a few charts over the weekend; here are some that stood out as good tickers to get long:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170305/khc.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170305/khc.png" alt="$KHC - 2017-03-05 - Daily" /></a>
Here&rsquo;s $KHC. We have a nice pullback to the 20MA, offering great trade location. Stop loss can be placed around 87.52, at which point, we&rsquo;ll wait on the sidelines and look to get long again at the 200MA.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170305/ko.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170305/ko.png" alt="$KO - 2017-03-05 - Daily" /></a>
Here&rsquo;s $KO. We&rsquo;ve broken above the 200MA and closed above it. We can look to get long with a stop at 41.51.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170305/so.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170305/so.png" alt="$SO - 2017-03-05 - Daily" /></a>
Here&rsquo;s $SO. We&rsquo;ve held above the 200MA. We can look to get long with a stop at 48.04.</p>

<p>As always, think about the risk first, and size up your position according to how much you are comfortable with losing if your stop were to get hit. Once set, enjoy the ride with the trend.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>We have another candidate that presents a long opportunity at a pullback to the 50 day MA - $CLF. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170303/clf.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170303/clf.png" alt="$CLF - 2017-03-03 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 50MA, $CLF provides a good long entry as is. Stop will be placed at 8.49, at which point, we can step back and observe how it trades near the 200MA. As always, size your position according to your personal risk tolerance!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/27/long-tdc/">Similar to our long idea on $TDC</a>, $DISCA also provides the a great setup for us. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170228/disca.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170228/disca.png" alt="$DISCA - 2017-02-28 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 20MA, $DISCA offers a good location to get long. Our stop would be around 26.07. As $DISCA moves up, we&rsquo;ll also trail our stop below the 200MA.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/27/long-tdc/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-27T14:23:11-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/27/long-tdc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p>We love stocks that have reclaimed the 200MA that are above the 50MA and 20MA as well. What&rsquo;s even better is when they pull back to one of these moving averages. One candidate is $TDC, which has pulled back to the 20MA and held. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170227/tdc.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170227/tdc.png" alt="$TDC - 2017-02-27 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 20MA, $TDC offers a good location to get long. Because it is currently a bit far from the 200MA, and with our stop around 27.36, it means that our position size would need to be smaller. But that&rsquo;s fine - the important thing to remember when trying to ride trends is that you want to do it without getting stopped out, and you want your stop to be placed at a point where you&rsquo;re proven wrong, with some buffer added to account for potential noise. Based on this stop distance, you would then calculate your position size to fit your risk tolerance. Again, as with many of our other trades, we&rsquo;re in this trade to ride the trend for as long as possible. As $TDC moves up, we&rsquo;ll also trail our stop below the 200MA.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/26/fcx-another-opportunity/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-26T22:22:29-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/26/fcx-another-opportunity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p>One of the things that we love most about stocks is trading them in the direction of the trend, at an area of value. By area of value, we mean at places like retracements. One particular stock that shows this is $FCX. Check out the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png" alt="$FCX - 2017-02-26 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 200MA, FCX provides a good long entry at 13.25. As this stock tends to overshoot past the 200MA, one can consider entering a bit beneath it as well. However, the stop placement should take that into consideration as well and be placed well below it. Though a further stop reduces the size of the position one can place, it also allows us to ride the trend longer. If anything, we can always add to the position on another pullback if $FCX does continue higher.</p>
