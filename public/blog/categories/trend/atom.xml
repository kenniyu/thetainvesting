    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Security software and services has been doing quite well this year, <a href="http://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&amp;v=210&amp;o=perfytd" title="Top Performing Sectors - 15.7% Return on Security Software and Services">showing a 15.7% return on investment</a>. Symantec $SYMC is one of the stocks in this industry. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<h3 id="20170204-symc">$SYMC</h3>


<p><a href="/images/blog/20170204/symc.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170204/symc.png" alt="SYMC - 2017-02-04 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Here is $SYMC on the weekly. As it just broke out to new 11 year highs this week, $SYMC is headed well for the all time highs at $34. Of course, this won&rsquo;t happen over the next week or month, so to be able to sustain a move in that direction for a long duration, consider this trade:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170204/symcoc.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170204/symcoc.png" alt="SYMC - 2017-02-04 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Here, we are buying the 30/34 call spread expiring in April, that expires in 76 days (from today), for a .47 debit or $47. Max profit is achieved if $SYMC reaches $34 by expiration - the value of this spread will be $400. If this happens, that&rsquo;s a return of over roughly 8*R (where R, risk = 47). Consider lowering the cost of the debit by selling nearer term put options. If so, R would essentially be lower, and the reward to risk ratio becomes significantly higher, which is great!</p>

<p>Lastly, we like to trade in the direction of the trend, so this is a trade to watch out for come Monday.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With earnings still pretty far away, we&rsquo;re considering long PCLN. Please observe the chart below.</p>

<h3 id="20170123-pcln">PCLN</h3>


<p><a href="/images/blog/20170123/pcln.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170123/pcln.png" alt="PCLN - 2017-01-23 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Last week, we broke the descending trendline, but were unable to move anywhere. A lot of balance occured in a relatively small range. We finally saw a move up higher into today&rsquo;s close, and based on that, we will aim to go long with a target set at the 1600 level.</p>
