    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/27/long-tdc/">Similar to our long idea on $TDC</a>, $DISCA also provides the a great setup for us. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170228/disca.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170228/disca.png" alt="$DISCA - 2017-02-28 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 20MA, $DISCA offers a good location to get long. Our stop would be around 26.07. As $DISCA moves up, we&rsquo;ll also trail our stop below the 200MA.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p>We love stocks that have reclaimed the 200MA that are above the 50MA and 20MA as well. What&rsquo;s even better is when they pull back to one of these moving averages. One candidate is $TDC, which has pulled back to the 20MA and held. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170227/tdc.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170227/tdc.png" alt="$TDC - 2017-02-27 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 20MA, $TDC offers a good location to get long. Because it is currently a bit far from the 200MA, and with our stop around 27.36, it means that our position size would need to be smaller. But that&rsquo;s fine - the important thing to remember when trying to ride trends is that you want to do it without getting stopped out, and you want your stop to be placed at a point where you&rsquo;re proven wrong, with some buffer added to account for potential noise. Based on this stop distance, you would then calculate your position size to fit your risk tolerance. Again, as with many of our other trades, we&rsquo;re in this trade to ride the trend for as long as possible. As $TDC moves up, we&rsquo;ll also trail our stop below the 200MA.</p>

    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/26/fcx-another-opportunity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p>One of the things that we love most about stocks is trading them in the direction of the trend, at an area of value. By area of value, we mean at places like retracements. One particular stock that shows this is $FCX. Check out the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png" alt="$FCX - 2017-02-26 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 200MA, FCX provides a good long entry at 13.25. As this stock tends to overshoot past the 200MA, one can consider entering a bit beneath it as well. However, the stop placement should take that into consideration as well and be placed well below it. Though a further stop reduces the size of the position one can place, it also allows us to ride the trend longer. If anything, we can always add to the position on another pullback if $FCX does continue higher.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>One stock that makes a good long candidate is $RIG, as it just reclaimed the 50MA and is above the 200MA. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170223/rig.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170223/rig.png" alt="$RIG - 2017-02-23 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Entry would be around 14.23, and stop would be placed outside the average noise, below the 200MA at around 12.01. As always, remember to always trade with the trend, and ride it for as long as possible.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/16/fireworks-for-swks/"/>
    <updated>2017-02-16T22:07:45-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/16/fireworks-for-swks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders,</p>

<p>We particularly like to look for stocks that are currently consolidating with a potential of moving higher with the trend of the market. One particular candidate to put on our watchlist is $SWKS. Please observe the chart below</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170216/swks.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170216/swks.png" alt="$SWKS - 2017-02-16 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>$SWKS has exploded like a firework after earnings and has recently consolidated around the 92 level. As the 20MA catches up, we&rsquo;re looking for buyers to step in and hold price above that curve. We&rsquo;re looking for another set of fireworks - a breakout above 94. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to start accumulating some long deltas. For stock, we&rsquo;ll be going long at 91.80 with a stop below the 20MA at 87.46.</p>
