    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We continue to chop and grind here on low volume. Nothing interesting happening here that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned before. All of the charts pretty much look the same as Friday, but I&rsquo;ll post them here again.</p>

<p>SPX:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with one trade idea for tomorrow. We&rsquo;ve been putting on quite some trades, so its wise we have time each day to manage each as necessary (though not a lot of management has been necessary so far for many of our trades).</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a trade idea on LNKD:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png"><img src="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png" alt="LNKD - 2016-03-28 Range-Bound" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m expecting for the stock to slowly grind lower or meander in between the 100 to 125 price range. If it does manage to get down to 100, I&rsquo;m expecting a bounce to occur, as it has been a while since we&rsquo;ve tested that prior support level. Because of these reasons, I think a put backratio would allow us to capture profits on a slow move down, as well as any moves up. Here is the 105/102 put backratio in APR:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd_risk_graph.png" alt="LNKD Risk Graph - 2016-03-28 Put Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>We have big downside risk, so management is key here. We may be able to turn this into a cheap butterfly later as well, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to receive my trade entries and adjustments in real time.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/23/an-edge-to-the-bears</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We finally saw a bone thrown to the Bears camp. When traders accepted prices below the value area today, that was a bearish signal. All of this could change, but this is definitely an edge to the Bears.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03232016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03232016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>From a candlestick pattern analysis, on the SPX, we formed a Doji yesterday and traded below that. This is once again negative on the year, so watch for continuation here. 2060 could still be the target until we see more downside.</p>

<p>The DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03232016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03232016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>We fell back from tagging that trendline resistance mentioned a couple of days ago - we may be starting to pick up momentum, so similar to the SPX, watch for continuation as well.</p>

<p>The NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03232016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03232016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Trading Below 61.% Fibonacci Retracement Level" /></a></p>

<p>As it has been recently, it was the weakest of the bunch, closing today below the 200 DMA and trading right below the 61.8% fib.</p>

<p>The RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03232016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03232016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level - Look Above and Fail" /></a></p>

<p>The look-above-and-fail pattern confirmed today and we took out all the gains, now sitting at the 50% fib. Also monitor for continuation to the downside here.</p>

<p>Essentially, all indices pointing down, and in my opinion, we should continue to see lower prices.</p>

<p>Here are the trades we entered in today if you followed me on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SOLD 1/-1/1 CUSTOM <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GDX&amp;src=ctag">$GDX</a> 100 APR 16/APR 16/APR 16 20.5/19.5/18.5 CALL/PUT/PUT @.14</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/712634816756195329">March 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>No management is necessary for all current and existing trades. These have been added to the <a href="/trades" title="Trades">Trades page</a>, with risk graphs shown. I try to keep the risk graphs up-to-date as often as possible.</p>

<p>With that, I&rsquo;ll leave us once again with just one trade idea for tomorrow - FXI:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png"><img src="/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png" alt="FXI - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Fade China" /></a></p>

<p>We had a nice pop from last week, and a nice rally for a whole month now. I think a fade play here would be nice. Something like selling the APR 34 call and buying the 32/31 put vertical. I&rsquo;ll tweet out the trade.</p>

<p>Remember that the markets are closed on Friday.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/22/decision-point</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market stalls here.</p>

<p>We had the SPX close today on a Doji - this doesn&rsquo;t mean a reversal is coming, it just means indecision, or consolidation, before a break out higher or lower. The longer we consolidate, the more forceful the breakout, so do keep that in mind. Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>We actually peeked above the consolidation area not once, but twice, since yesterday. While that may seem bearish, keep in mind we did the same look-below-and-fail today. So still, trade is being dominated by short-term traders.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Tag" /></a></p>

<p>It actually tagged that trendline resistance and fell back a bit, which was what we expected. If the markets continue to exhibit weakness tomorrow, I&rsquo;m considering the APR5 177.5/180 call spread going for .98 cr right now.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Grinding Higher" /></a></p>

<p>It actually continued higher today and was the strongest of the bunch. Not surprising here as it was the laggard for most of the huge rally that the SPX had.</p>

<p>And the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday we were looking for either a follow through higher from possibly a bounce off of the trendline support, but we did not get that. Earlier during today&rsquo;s session, it appeared that yesterday&rsquo;s session was nothing but a look-above-and-fail, but by the end of today, we didn&rsquo;t have a look-below-and-fail, either. Again, indecision here, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Overall, the indices spell very mixed signals. On one hand, you have the NDX up and the DJX down, but both SPX and RUT aren&rsquo;t sure where to go. The longer the market stays in a tight consolidation range, the more explosive the breakout. Stay aware.</p>

<p>Today we got filled on three trades:</p>

<p>These trades are now being logged in the <a href="/trades" title="Trades">Trades page</a> section of the site, so we&rsquo;ll continue monitoring these trades and managing as necessary. Updates will be posted on that page over time.</p>

<p>Potential trades for tomorrow:</p>

<p>Earlier today I was looking at PCLN as a potential candidate for a balanced butterfly, centered around the 1300 level. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png" alt="PCLN - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Channel Support" /></a></p>

<p>There is an ascending trendline support which should end up at around 1300 by this Thursday. In the event of a slight downdraft in the markets, we may be able to find support here. There&rsquo;s also a rising channel support going back to the gap up from earnings. This should help the 1300 level act as a support as well.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/pcln_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/pcln_risk_graph.png" alt="PCLN Risk Graph - 2016-03-22 - Balanced Butterfly" /></a></p>

<p>The 1310/1300/1290 butterfly is currently being priced for about .80 db. I&rsquo;ll be trying to lowball this for about .50.</p>

<p>And for DIA:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/dia.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/dia.png" alt="DIA - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Short &amp; Long Strikes" /></a></p>

<p>In the market recap before, I mentioned that if the market exhibits weakness and we see all indices drop, a 177.5/180 call vertical on DIA would not be a bad idea.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png" alt="DIA Risk Graoh - 2016-03-22 - Vertical Credit Call Spread" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s currently being priced at about 1.01 cr for the spread expiring on APR5, but depending on when the fill happens and how much the market drops, it&rsquo;ll be lower.</p>

<p>Another trade idea here is GDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png" alt="GDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a bit of a pullback from this big run that we&rsquo;ve had. As GDX stalls here, I&rsquo;m hoping to collect some premium on the call side, possibly the APR 21.5 naked call, and I&rsquo;m also looking to add a more bearish bias, as we&rsquo;re at the top of this channel resistance. To that effect, I&rsquo;m considering buying the 20/19 put spread, also in APR. Together, this should bring in about .22 cr.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03222016/gdx_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03222016/gdx_risk_graph.png" alt="GDX Risk Graph - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation" /></a></p>

    <updated>2016-03-21T19:05:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/21/expecting-a-turnaround-very-soon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We continue to grind higher.</p>

<p>SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Gap Fill" /></a></p>

<p>The 2060 target mentioned for a while now is just within reach. Due to the slowing momentum, I&rsquo;m looking to enter into a 2100/2110 short call vertical spread on the SPX, currently going for 1.70 cr once that trendline is reached and we exhibit signs of a turnaround.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Tag" /></a></p>

<p>We tagged the trendline resistance today. I am expecting this to stall around here, while the SPX climbs higher to tag its trendline.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>We crossed the 61.8% fib level today, so the next level of resistance is the trendline resistance. However, given the slowing momentum we have in all of the other indices, I don&rsquo;t expect NDX to actually reach that trendline resistance on this run.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>The RUT was the weakest of the bunch today, closing down, but still above the trendline support. We&rsquo;ll need to see more follow-through to the upside if the market were truly bullish, but that may be a bit hard given how much we&rsquo;ve come off from the lows, and also the fact that there is a 61.8% fib level there as well. I do expect some stalling to occur here, but keep an eye out on this, as we could easily fall below that support, making for a classic look-above-and-fail pattern.</p>

<p>The upcoming week is key and will most likely determine whether or not we get the retracement in the market that many, including me, have been looking for. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>In the meantime, for those that followed me on Twitter, here is the trade we got filled on today:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s breaking support. BOT BUTTERFLY <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=ctag">$AMZN</a> 100 APR 16 480/475/465 PUT @-.17</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/711923212490121216">March 21, 2016</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>And the risk profile per spread:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/amzn_risk_profile.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/amzn_risk_profile.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Unbalanced Butterfly Risk Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the chart of AMZN on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/amzn.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/amzn.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Approximate Support" /></a></p>

<p>I expect us to find some support around the prior lows in the area of about 475 to 500. Because I didn&rsquo;t have a specific target in mind, only an approximate area, plus the fact that I think we&rsquo;ll stall around there, a theta-positive, risk-defined trade here may not be such a bad idea. If we aren&rsquo;t able to clearly break support (which we couldn&rsquo;t by the end of today, we actually had a look-below-and-fail) and we end up moving higher, we still make money. As for trade management, since we don&rsquo;t want to take on the max loss here, we&rsquo;ll be looking to manage if AMZN does indeed fall down hard.</p>

<p>Also, given how UNG closed today, I think we are in for another leg lower, and the measured target would be 5.61:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/ung.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/ung.png" alt="UNG - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance, Fibonacci Extension" /></a></p>

<p>I would like to see us break the lows of 5.78 first, though. As for the entry point, looking at the chart on an intraday basis, a break below 6.4 should trigger us into the short:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/ung_short_entry.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/ung_short_entry.png" alt="UNG - 2016-03-21 Hourly Time Frame - Short Entry Point" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to sell the APR5 6.5 call and buy the APR5 6 put for about .17 cr. Look out for my tweet on this.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, HD:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03212016/hd.png"><img src="/images/blog/03212016/hd.png" alt="HD - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I completely got sidetracked by work while an entry was available here today - unfortunately it seems like we&rsquo;re no longer able to get a credit for putting on the 133/135 call backratio right now (currently going for .09 debit). I&rsquo;ll continue monitoring this for a good entry, and I&rsquo;ll post it live on Twitter as well.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets tomorrow, and <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates in real-time.</p>
