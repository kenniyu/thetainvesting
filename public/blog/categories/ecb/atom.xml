    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The markets continue to move sideways before the ECB announcement tomorrow. Not a lot of volume was traded today. Be cautious heading into the event.</p>

<p>TRIP continues to move to the downside. For those who shorted this from yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea, just trail your stop loss. We may get another bounce at around 60 (we got one today) before we head to the previous lows.</p>

<p>CMG gapped lower due to some news. For those who shorted this from yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea, just continue to trail your stop loss here as well.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t know how much Draghi can do to rally the markets higher. In my opinion, whatever easing he&rsquo;s thinking of implementing is already priced in by the market. If he fails to deliver nothing more than a huge amount of money, the market will probably not take that as a good sign. Just saying. Whatever the case, be prepared.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today, have a safe trading day tomorrow.</p>
