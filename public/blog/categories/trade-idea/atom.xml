    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey traders!</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2017/02/27/long-tdc/">Similar to our long idea on $TDC</a>, $DISCA also provides the a great setup for us. Please observe the chart below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170228/disca.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170228/disca.png" alt="$DISCA - 2017-02-28 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>With a pullback to the 20MA, $DISCA offers a good location to get long. Our stop would be around 26.07. As $DISCA moves up, we&rsquo;ll also trail our stop below the 200MA.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hope everyone had a great Memorial weekend!</p>

<p>Today we placed a couple of new trades, one of them being on Gold:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BOT BUTTERFLY /GCQ6 1/100 JUL 16 /OGN6 (27) 1150/1135/1110 P at .20</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/737632334749388800">May 31, 2016</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart for /GC:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05312016/gc.png"><img src="/images/blog/05312016/gc.png" alt="/GC - 2016-05-31 - Daily Chart - Channel Support &amp; Analog Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an analog between the first break of the channel &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; and where /GC low-based (first pink rectangle), and where we just broke below that channel &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; later again at a higher price and where we may be low-basing going forward (right pink rectangle). We can expect the channel support to hold, and personally I will be long gold anywhere along that trendline. But for now, as long as /GC nears 1150 by expiration, we should be closing this trade out for a profit when the opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>This trade was posted live on Twitter this morning, and we&rsquo;ll be managing it together there as well. So if you haven&rsquo;t already, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to receive tweets about this trade and our other trades in real-time.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/21/will-the-bears-continue-the-selling-pressure/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-21T18:49:01-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/21/will-the-bears-continue-the-selling-pressure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We saw a nice liquidation break today, and actually saw the first sign of sellers being able to keep that pressure on throughout the entire RTH session. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the overall volume profile over the past 20 days:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-21 - Volume Profile - 20 days" /></a></p>

<p>We can see that today, not only did we clearly create value lower, but also look where the point of control migrated to: basically back to where it was on Monday. We&rsquo;re now exploring this area to see if this is the fairest price to do business.</p>

<p>And if we zoom in and take a closer look at the past couple of weeks:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/es_zoomed.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/es_zoomed.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-21 - Volume Profile - Zoomed In - Value Area Gapping Lower" /></a></p>

<p>Notice today, our value area not only migrated lower, but also it did not overlap yesterday&rsquo;s value area. When value areas gap like this, it <em>generally</em> signifies the start of a new trend (although a larger gap would&rsquo;ve been better to signify stronger selling pressure). Will the selling continue tomorrow? We can only wait to find out, but until then, bias is neutral.</p>

<p>Going forward, here are important reference points to keep in mind: I&rsquo;ll be watching how the <strong>2081.75</strong> level holds tomorrow. <strong>The area between 2067 and 2081.75 can be considered a balance area</strong>, which was formed last week for a few days before we broke higher out of it this Monday. If we fall back into this area tomorrow and we start seeing some really strong selling pressure (watch the internals), look to target the other side of that balance area, which is <strong>2067</strong>.</p>

<p>Before wrapping up, I&rsquo;d like to propose a trade idea, which I haven&rsquo;t in a while. Here&rsquo;s <strong>HAL</strong> on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/hal.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/hal.png" alt="HAL - 2016-04-21 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to position a trade around <strong>HAL</strong> that assumes the analog of what happened last year would happen again this year. If so, a trade that captures a slow retracement to the bottom of the right orange rectangle over the next month or so would probably be ideal.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any butterflies/put backratios that were great, so I was thinking a small calendar play may work here, specifically, the JUN/MAY 36 PUT calendar:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/hal_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/hal_calendar.png" alt="HAL - 2016-04-21 - Put Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>This is a much longer-term play, and we&rsquo;ll need to wait probably around a month or so for the premium to really start coming in. If you have a slight bearish bias on the energy sector, this could be the play for you.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that this company does have earnings coming up, but I&rsquo;m not really expecting the stock to move much to the downside, and we have quite some time for the trade to work out for us. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put this trade on tomorrow, so be on the lookout for that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today - as always, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<p>Good luck in the markets tomorrow, and remember to keep those reference points in mind on the /ES.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-17T12:37:47-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to remain cautiously bullish going into next week, given the massive overhead resistance we still have.</p>

<p>Looking at the broad market indices on the weekly, here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We finished last week with a wide body candle after <em>consolidating</em> for a couple of weeks prior. This leads me to believe that, if we do continue moving up, the trendline resistance up ahead is less likely to hold, given how close we consolidated just under that.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>The previous trendline resistance (now support) is holding up nicely. The same thing can be seen here - consolidation right underneath the 100% Fib level from back in November. This makes me think it&rsquo;s not hard to pierce that resistance level.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Again, same thing.</p>

<p>The RUT probably paints the clearest picture:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve consolidated over the past two weeks below the trendline and closed the week right up against it. That trendline can easily be invalidated, in which case we&rsquo;d have clearance to run up to the 1200 levels again.</p>

<p>Given what we just saw in the RUT, come Monday I&rsquo;m looking to put on a Call Calendar (again?!) in the RUT (unfortunately, the market has been extremely boring recently, and this is one of the bread and butter strategies during times of low volatility):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/rut_call_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/rut_call_calendar.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-17 - Call Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll manage this over the next month. The debit here is quite small for the potential gains we can achieve. If you have a bearish portfolio, this could be quite beneficial if the market does continue running higher.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this weekend. I&rsquo;ll be posting that trade, along with all other entries/adjustments, live on Twitter, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get all of my updates in real time.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/13/breaking-out-of-balance/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-13T18:18:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/13/breaking-out-of-balance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market broke out of balance very clearly today to the upside as we mentioned yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04132016/esm6.png"><img src="/images/blog/04132016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-13 - Market Profile - 15d Zoomed In" /></a></p>

<p>We attempted to trade back below balance, but failed as buyers kept the market up.</p>

<p>On the SPX, we now have clearance to tag the uppermost trendline resistance this Friday at around 2090.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04132016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04132016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-13 - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Also, from now on for the SPX chart, the pink rectangles will be removed - the target here has been reached.</p>

<p>Watch for the top of the balance area to hold as support, because we can just as easily fail tomorrow and fall back into the balance area, which is not a strong Bullish signal. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll be looking for a rotation all the way back down to the bottom of the balance area (2012) as a weekly play. However, tomorrow, I&rsquo;m looking for some consolidation before any moves higher.</p>

<p>One of the plays that I&rsquo;m looking at currently is the SPY MAY2/APR5 211/210 Diagonal Call spread, currently going for about .26 debit:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04132016/spy_call_diagonal.png"><img src="/images/blog/04132016/spy_call_diagonal.png" alt="SPY Diagonal Call Spread - 2016-04-13 - Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>This has breakevens at around 206 and 212 over the next few weeks. Given the low volatility that we&rsquo;ve been having and the low confidence in any downmove, as long as we stay in this range, we should be good to milk some premium. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put this on tomorrow.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. I&rsquo;ll keep posting new entries/adjustments on Twitter, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get all of my updates in real time.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets and good trading!</p>
