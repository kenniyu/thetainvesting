    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m certain the markets will continue to climb higher next week.</p>

<p>There are just not enough sellers out there. On Friday, we were able to enter into the second distribution area from the Janet Yellen day:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-02 - Weak Sellers Failing to Take Market Lower Regardless of Poor Structure" /></a></p>

<p>But before spending enough time there, we couldn&rsquo;t find more sellers to come in. What I was expecting to happen when we broke into the second distribution area was that we at least test the 2033.5 level (and it should be relatively easy to get there due to the extremely poor structure). Obviously that didn&rsquo;t happen, and instead, on Friday during RTH, we ended up moving back up over the overnight low and through the open (which was a strong buy signal). Overnight shorts did not get paid, got nervous, and we saw the market run higher for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Is that bearish? No. Sellers are extremely nervous out there still, and looking at the tape, every time they tried to take this market lower, they completely failed, even when structurally it was easy for them to do so. So regardless of how overbought this market is right now, we should be thinking bullish into next week. We&rsquo;ll have some trade ideas presented later this weekend based around this bullish bias, but first:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/spx_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/spx_daily.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-02 - Daily - Bullish - Trendline Resistance Becomes Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how we tried to break down, but ended up finding support at what was previously the trendline resistance. A classic look below and fail pattern - <strong>pretty bullish</strong>. First target here is the top of the range extension denoted by the top right pink box, which is around 2084, followed by the next trendline resistance at around 2090, and then the even 2100.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/spx_weekly.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/spx_weekly.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>Strong momentum.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly - Breaking Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Again, strong momentum. It actually broke through the trendline resistance. Target here would be 180.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly - 61.8% Fib Level Acts as Support" /></a></p>

<p>It found support off that 61.8% Fib level. Next target is that trendline resistance.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-02 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>Which looks like it may just plow through that trendline resistance, and if so, the next target would be back up to 1200.</p>

<p>Given the doubt that many have on how much higher this market can really run, but keeping in mind the bullish targets explained just above, I have a few options trade ideas that may work well just for this scenario. This will be done in a separate post which I will tweet out later this weekend, so stay tuned, and <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me</a> if you haven&rsquo;t already so that you&rsquo;ll know about it right when I tweet it out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not a lot of updates for today. For tomorrow, keep in mind the reference points pointed out a couple of days ago (those that separate the distributions):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03312016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/03312016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-31 - Three Separate Distributions - Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve denoted them by the dashed blue horizontal price levels. Also keep in mind the unemployment rate and non-farm employment change data coming out tomorrow at 8:30 am EST. Those could potentially be market movers and may entice more buyers/sellers to come in.</p>

<p>I think this market has been waiting for a move lower, so if we break lower, watch for volume. That will be an indicator of if sellers are still weak out there, or if they&rsquo;re coming in strong.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all the updates for today.</p>

<p>Also, no trade ideas planned, but I may be posting new trades live on Twitter tomorrow as I do every day, so you should be <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">following me</a> to get my updates in real-time.</p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/30/whats-new-nothing-bias-still-to-the-upside</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We continue to float higher:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03302016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/03302016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-30 15m Time Frame - Multiple Distributions - Gap Higher" /></a></p>

<p>Towards the beginning of today&rsquo;s session we saw a liquidation break which looked like it was going to fill the overnight gap on the /ES - that is what should&rsquo;ve happened if the Bears were really here. Unfortunately for them, all we had was a slow grind lower, which wasn&rsquo;t a convincing move (I <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/715222086789111808" title="Slow Grind Lower Tweet">tweeted this out</a> as we were gradually trading lower). Not only did we snap higher, but by the end of the day, we weren&rsquo;t able to even fill the gap on the /ES.</p>

<p>What the Bears needed today was a gap down to the lowest distribution (denoted by the bottom-most blue rectangle) and build value there - that would&rsquo;ve signified a more bearish signal. Instead, not only did we <strong>not</strong> trade in the middle or top-most distribution, but price actually gapped above and traders accepted prices up at where we currently are. That&rsquo;s quite a bullish signal. On weak structure, of course. But again, don&rsquo;t fight price.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03302016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03302016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Breached" /></a></p>

<p>Our 2060 target was reached. That trendline resistance has been broken, and is now meaningless. The next target would now be around 2095.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03302016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03302016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Breached" /></a></p>

<p>This closed above the trendline resistance, also rendering it useless.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03302016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03302016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>This is still on track to touching the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03302016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03302016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Doji Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>Closing above the 61.8% Fib level on a Doji (consolidation). This was actually quite weak today. The trendline resistance could be tagged, so look to see if we continue or reverse tomorrow.</p>

<p>By the way, that put backratio that we put on for LNKD yesterday turned out great today. For those of you who are in this trade, if you want to turn this into a 100% winner, 0% risk trade, buy the 98 put to turn the backratio into a balanced butterfly (this put option costs less than the credit we received when we put this trade on). Your max profit is reduced by the cost of this additional put that you buy, and regardless of where LNKD moves, this trade is an absolute winner.

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/29/more-weak-structure-and-reference-points/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-29T22:35:18-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/29/more-weak-structure-and-reference-points</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market continues to rally on poor structure. Today after Yellen&rsquo;s speech, the /ES created three distributions, separated by single print spikes:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03292016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/03292016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-03-29 - Three Separate Distributions" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve highlighted the distribution areas in blue. These single prints tend to act as levels for bounce plays, especially when the market is dominated by mostly short-term traders. For tomorrow, keep these weak reference points in mind. These are 2043.50 and 2033.50.</p>

<p>Here are the broad market indices:</p>

<p>SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03292016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03292016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>This will most likely reach our 2060 target.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03292016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03292016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>A retest of the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03292016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03292016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame" /></a></p>

<p>This is well on its way to the trendline resistance.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03292016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03292016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame" /></a></p>

<p>Closing above the 61.8% Fib level.</p>

<p>Bias remains bullish, so don&rsquo;t fight it.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/26/bias-remains-to-the-upside-currently/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-26T17:38:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/26/bias-remains-to-the-upside-currently</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember this chart from last Friday?</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03182016/esm6_thurs_fri.png"><img src="/images/blog/03182016/esm6_thurs_fri.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Single Prints Separating Distributions as Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>If you missed the explanation of what these reference points mean, <a href="/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/" title="/ES Weak Reference Points">please take a look</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to Thursday&rsquo;s action, I was thinking that perhaps this could be the turning point for the Bears to step in and take the market back lower. However, from Thursday&rsquo;s action:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/es_f.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/es_f.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Bias Continues to Upside" /></a></p>

<p>We came close to the 2012 level, and instead of taking out that weak reference point, we bounced off hard and the Bulls took the market back up to fill the gap between Wednesday and Thursday. So the way we edge lower has me thinking that we will test 2060 soon on the SPX and possibly take that out and move higher to about 2090.</p>

<p>At the same time, value built lower on Thursday because most of the time was spent trading around 2016 on the /ES. And while we did finish the day filling the gap, late day rallies (and selloffs) are usually suspect and unsustainable. So Bulls, don&rsquo;t get too excited here. Keep value in mind, and don&rsquo;t be fooled by price (don&rsquo;t fight it, either).</p>

<p>Shorter term time frame traders are still dominating here, and structure remains weak. The only way the edge will shift to the Bears is if we take out that 2012 level (basically Thursday&rsquo;s low). After that, look for the next weak low at 1995 to be taken out.</p>

<p>Until then, bias still remains to the upside.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I believe the 2060 target is not out of play and may be reached soon. Looking at the other indices, I think we may consolidate there more before moving higher, which makes for a possible trade here which I&rsquo;ll show below.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/djx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>Same comment as the SPX.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/ndx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>Still under the 61.8% fib level, which doesn&rsquo;t mean much as a resistance level given how much we&rsquo;ve traded back and forth between this level.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>The 61.8 fib level is still in play here as resistance.</p>

<p>Ok, trade ideas:</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m looking for the SPX to head to 2060 and stall there a bit, here&rsquo;s the play:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/spx_diagonal.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/spx_diagonal.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-26 - Diagonal Call Spread" /></a></p>

<p>We front some debit here, and will incur losses if SPX blows through the 2060 very quickly, so this will need to be managed if that happens (keep a close eye on this and my Twitter). We want SPX to expire near our short strike by its expiration. Now this will have to be priced in again on Monday and will depend on how the futures trade Sunday night. I&rsquo;ll tweet this trade out if I end up putting it on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking at AMZN:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/amzn.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/amzn.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-26 Daily Time Frame - Range Extension - 61.8% Fibonnaci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Last week we put a trade on for AMZN that would take advantage of a slow grind down to prior support levels at around 475. After doing so, we got faked out when the 547 support broke, and for the rest of the week, AMZN grinded higher. This is great for our position, as we had put it on for a credit, so the further it&rsquo;s away from our unbalanced butterfly, the higher the probability that we win on this trade (of course, we would like AMZN to trade near our short strikes for max profit, but a winner is a winner).</p>

<p>This week, I&rsquo;m looking for upside follow-through in this stock. Notice how the 50% fib level acts as the resistance level. If we pierce through this, and if the market does indeed turn around and move higher, I think we at least head to the 61.8 fib level and possibly double the range of the consolidation area that we&rsquo;ve had since February (between 547 and 585, ~ 35 points) and head to 620. Of course, because we&rsquo;ve retraced a long way from the 547 lows, the best way to hit 620 would be for AMZN to make a slight pullback before breaking the 50% fib level. Keep that point in mind, because we&rsquo;ll use that information to manage our trade. So here&rsquo;s the trade I&rsquo;m thinking:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/amzn_condor.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/amzn_condor.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-03-26 Risk Graph - Condor" /></a></p>

<p>We can place a condor with a slight debit (.92 currently) with 1 week to go. If AMZN is able to reach the 61.8% fib level and close around there, we&rsquo;ll collect the max profit of 9.05. We should be looking to manage this trade by looking at the market action, in case we get a look above and fail. I&rsquo;ll also tweet out this trade when I end up putting it on, so keep watch.</p>

<p>Another one is EWZ:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/ewz.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/ewz.png" alt="EWZ - 2016-03-26 Support and Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to sell a strangle here in May - not sure why the implied volatility here is pretty rich. But I also have a bearish bias on this, so I&rsquo;m looking to buy a put spread as well. Here is the trade:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03262016/ewz_strangle_put_vertical.png"><img src="/images/blog/03262016/ewz_strangle_put_vertical.png" alt="EWZ - 2016-03-26 Strangle and Put Vertical" /></a></p>

<p>Breakevens are at around 19.1 and 30.9. We can put this on for about a .84 cr.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck in the markets. Remember to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> as that is where I&rsquo;ll be posting my trades up in real-time.</p>
