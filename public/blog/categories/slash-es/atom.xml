    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why next week should be bullish</p>

<p>Much of the trade this past week contributed to developing the big balance area between 2082.50 and 2106:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-06-04 - 1h Chart - Balance Area" /></a></p>

<p>Notice where most of the volume took place over the past 5 days:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/es_15m.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/es_15m.png" alt="/ES - 2016-06-04 - 15m Chart Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>The fairest price to do business appears to be right in the middle of this balance area. This is neutral so far.</p>

<p>However, as a point in the Bulls camp, note how we&rsquo;ve had multiple liquidation breaks with no significant follow-through to the downside, and in multiple sessions, we ended with the Bulls taking it right back up to near 2100. On the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/es_tails.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/es_tails.png" alt="/ES - 2016-06-04 - Daily Bottoming-Tails" /></a></p>

<p>Note the bottoming-tail hammers. There are 5 of them all within the balance area. An edge to the Bulls.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the indices on the weekly, here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-06-04 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Doji forming above trendline support.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-06-04 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Bottoming tail above trendline support.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-06-04 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Doji right at trendline resistance. This could make for a big breakout.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/06042016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/06042016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-06-04 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>The strongest of them all, Maintaining the breakout above multiple trendline supports.</p>

<p>Keep these points in mind going into next week. Though we&rsquo;re currently neutral and in balance, the shorts seem extremely nervous and are unable to push prices lower given every opportunity they&rsquo;ve had.</p>

<p>Could we continue to remain in balance next week? Absolutely, and if so, the resulting breakout would be more violent. But be prepared for a breakout this coming week to the upside.</p>

<p>This past week, we made many trade adjustments. Keep an eye on <a href="/trades#KORS" title="KORS">KORS</a>, <a href="/trades#NFLX" title="NFLX">NFLX</a>, <a href="/trades#CL_F" title="/CL">/CL</a>, <a href="/trades#SQ" title="SQ">SQ</a>, and <a href="/trades#SLV" title="SLV">SLV</a> as potential winners to manage.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s the volume composite again on the /ES over the past month:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05262016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05262016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-26 - 1h Chart - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still watching the high volume nodes at 2075 and 2085 to see how they develop.</p>

<p>This past week, we&rsquo;ve seen value area gapping higher, which is bullish. After a few sessions, expect a pause and some rebalancing before the trend either continues or reverses. We may get that pause today as we&rsquo;re trading near the highest high volume node.</p>

<p>Yesterday we put on call calendars on AAPL and NFLX. AAPL hasn&rsquo;t done much since, but NFLX looks to be trading up 4 premarket. This is good for our short term calendar, but our longer term call ratio will be hurting a bit here. No worries as we have time to work it out, and our breakeven is a bit above 105, which is the gap fill. We&rsquo;ll see what happens and adjust if necessary.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook. We&rsquo;ll be doing more trade adjustments today, so as always, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me there</a> to receive tweets about our trades in real-time.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>/ES broke out of the descending channel yesterday and closed strong above it. This is slightly bullish, but in a long term perspective, still neutral:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05252016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05252016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-25 - 1h Chart - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m expecting tomorrow&rsquo;s action to pause a bit, especially after such a rally. If this happens, it only makes the developing volume node at 2075 more prominent.</p>

<p>Watch how the volume composite develops throughout this week. 2075 to 2085 could become the high volume node over the past 30 days. Also, developing value at the upper end of the balance area primes us for a stronger breakout to the upside.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the market outlook. As always, we&rsquo;ll be entering new trades and adjusting/exiting our existing positions, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/05/24/market-still-remains-in-balance-be-theta-positive/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a market that barely moves these days, it&rsquo;s great when the core of your portfolio is theta positive. We already are, but this is just an emphasis on that fact.</p>

<p>The market is still stuck within the large balance area between 2080 and 2012, with 2052 being a very prominent volume node:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05242016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05242016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-24 - 1h Chart - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>The next prominent HVN over the past 30 days appears to be 2075, which is towards the upper end of this balance area. 2075 would be the first upside target to aim for if we see the market move higher. Placing a butterfly there for a credit would be a great play, or some kind of a call ratio with more room to the upside. I&rsquo;ll be looking for something to do here.</p>

<p>Volume has been extremely low during these past trading sessions, but for us, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Keep that in mind, though, as a breakout of the balance area may cause volume to start picking back up again, and depending on your portfolio, you may need to adjust.</p>

<p>Yesterday we opened new trades on $NFLX, $TGT and $ES_F. These all seem to be looking good so far. Keep an eye on $NFLX - I think it&rsquo;s going to be interesting seeing how it plays out.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the market outlook. As always, we&rsquo;ll be entering new trades and adjusting/exiting our existing positions, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets today!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, we had a whole lot of nothing, closing the week flat where we started:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05232016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05232016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-23 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Notice the developing high volume node around 2050 on the /ES:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05232016/es_profile.png"><img src="/images/blog/05232016/es_profile.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-23 - 4h Chart - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>Traders love this spot, and it&rsquo;s smack in the middle of our big balance area. Consider buying wide, weekly butterflies in this area to capture a lot of theta.</p>

<p>So what I&rsquo;m looking for this week on the /ES is for us to continue staying in balance along this descending channel:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05232016/es_channel.png"><img src="/images/blog/05232016/es_channel.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-23 - 1d Chart - Descending Channel" /></a></p>

<p>Watch for bounces off of the channel support and resistance.</p>

<p>Last week we booked many winners. We had a few losers which were the small calendar debits we payed for, but they were offset by the winners significantly. As always, we&rsquo;ll be entering new trades and adjusting/exiting our existing positions, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>
