    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The market broke out of balance very clearly today to the upside as we mentioned yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04132016/esm6.png"><img src="/images/blog/04132016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-13 - Market Profile - 15d Zoomed In" /></a></p>

<p>We attempted to trade back below balance, but failed as buyers kept the market up.</p>

<p>On the SPX, we now have clearance to tag the uppermost trendline resistance this Friday at around 2090.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04132016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04132016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-13 - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Also, from now on for the SPX chart, the pink rectangles will be removed - the target here has been reached.</p>

<p>Watch for the top of the balance area to hold as support, because we can just as easily fail tomorrow and fall back into the balance area, which is not a strong Bullish signal. If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll be looking for a rotation all the way back down to the bottom of the balance area (2012) as a weekly play. However, tomorrow, I&rsquo;m looking for some consolidation before any moves higher.</p>

<p>One of the plays that I&rsquo;m looking at currently is the SPY MAY2/APR5 211/210 Diagonal Call spread, currently going for about .26 debit:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04132016/spy_call_diagonal.png"><img src="/images/blog/04132016/spy_call_diagonal.png" alt="SPY Diagonal Call Spread - 2016-04-13 - Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>This has breakevens at around 206 and 212 over the next few weeks. Given the low volatility that we&rsquo;ve been having and the low confidence in any downmove, as long as we stay in this range, we should be good to milk some premium. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put this on tomorrow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had another late-day selloff. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if we gap up tomorrow morning as we have been doing so much these past couple of weeks.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04112016/esm6_15d.png"><img src="/images/blog/04112016/esm6_15d.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-11 - Market Profile - 15d" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still trading within the balance area between 2012.25 and 2067, so things still look neutral to me. The next, intermediate downside reference point is 2026. If we can build value near that area (remember 2025 is the POC from the Janet Yellen day - this is the day with the three blue distributions), then I&rsquo;d give the edge to the Bears. Until then, bias remains neutral, but be ready because those reference points below us are weak, as can be seen in the 20-day chart:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04112016/esm6_20d.png"><img src="/images/blog/04112016/esm6_20d.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-11 - Market Profile - 20d - Weak Reference Points" /></a></p>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/09/preparing-for-a-breakout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This market has been consolidating in a big balance area for a while now, with the volume POC for the past 15 days at around the 2040.75 level in the /ES:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04092016/esm6.png"><img src="/images/blog/04092016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-09 - Market Profile" /></a></p>

<p>The composite doesn&rsquo;t look quite skewed in any direction, so I would say we&rsquo;re right in the middle of this entire balance area between 2012 and 2067.</p>

<p>Keep in mind 2012 goes back to a spike high from March 16 (refer to <a href="/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/" title="Weak Reference Points">this post for more info</a> ), as well as a <em>close</em> touch of that point back in March 24. Keep this weak reference point in mind going forward.</p>

<p>Short term traders continue to be the dominant players here, getting themselves overly long or overly short. Until we see some bigger players come into play and break us out of balance, assume that we trade within the denoted range.</p>

<p>Overall, momentum in the board market indices does look like it is slowing and rounding off. My bias here is still neutral, and with such low IV, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be selling premium. If you have a directional bias and you&rsquo;re bearish, selling calls might not be a bad idea. Personally, I&rsquo;d want to be buying cheap OOM calendar spreads.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t really traded options on the indices in a while, but here&rsquo;s a trade idea on the SPY utilizing an OOM put calendar:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04092016/spy_put_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04092016/spy_put_calendar.png" alt="SPY - 2016-04-09 - Put Calendar Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like SPY to trade between 190 and 202 by expiration. Adjust strikes as necessary. If you want to collect a credit, you can think about moving the nearer term strike higher.</p>

<p>A simple call credit spread on the SPY is also not a bad idea. I may be looking to put some on this coming week, depending on conditions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about a Bullish play on AMZN:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04092016/amzn.png"><img src="/images/blog/04092016/amzn.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-04-09 - Daily - Sitting at Horizontal Support" /></a></p>

<p>AMZN is holding up at the horizontal support level and the upward trendline support level. One of the things I&rsquo;m looking to do is put on a call condor on AMZN that includes the earnings cycle, obviously as an earnings play. I&rsquo;ll also be looking to finance this condor by selling put spreads beneath trendline support for the weeks prior to earnings, as long as the market continues to stay in balance. The reason I&rsquo;m thinking about putting on this trade is that if the market does continue to stay in balance or climb higher, AMZN usually won&rsquo;t sell off and may even climb higher as well into earnings.</p>

<p>Currently the APR5 660/670/690/700 call condor is being priced in for about .89 debit:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04092016/amzn_call_condor.png"><img src="/images/blog/04092016/amzn_call_condor.png" alt="AMZN - 2016-04-09 - Call Condor Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>I might buy a few of these. These and the put spreads will need to be managed if AMZN starts to lose the support levels.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on these trades come Monday, so <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Short term traders still remain in control.</p>

<p>The price action has been volatile and we&rsquo;ve been having 100% retracements within very short periods of time - i.e. swings from one side of the lows to the highs the very next day. Just two days ago, shorts who tried to push the market lower by the end of the trading session got punished the very next day by the Bulls who took the market all the way up to the highs yesterday. Now, today we&rsquo;ve just reversed all of that and traded even lower today. There&rsquo;s no doubt that shorter term traders are in control here.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04072016/esm6_vp.png"><img src="/images/blog/04072016/esm6_vp.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-07 - Market Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s action touched yesterday&rsquo;s point of control early in the session before failing there, and for the rest of the day, traders built value lower to almost not overlapping. We even took out the weak reference point of 2033.5 and tagged the point of control going back to the Fed day shown by the 3 blue distribution areas on the left side. By the end of today&rsquo;s session, the POC migrated lower to near Apr 5th&rsquo;s POC.</p>

<p>Today was a very interesting day and it appears that the sellers are finally getting some control. Instead of being bought up after gapping down this morning, we actually continued selling and sentiment remained bearish all day.</p>

<p>Zooming out over the past 20 days, here is the volume profile:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04072016/esm6.png"><img src="/images/blog/04072016/esm6.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-07 - Market Profile Zoomed Out" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the reference points to watch out for tomorrow (and this is important due to the short term traders dominating):</p>

<p><strong>Settlement</strong>: 2034.75<br/>
<strong>POC</strong>: 2040<br/>
<strong>Value area high</strong>: 2043<br/>
<strong>Value area low</strong>: 2029.75<br/></p>

<p>Tomorrow, if we gap up, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be watching for:</p>

<ol>
<li>How far of a gap are we gapping up by? Anything around double digits is going to be a hard gap to fade unless internals are very bearish. If internals do show strong bearishness, I would look to target the POC and then after that, the settlement, then the value area low, then today&rsquo;s low (2026), then low of the Fed day (2019), then 2012 (the unvisited high of the March 16 spike). Watch for a bounce at any of these levels and look at internals for confirmation.</li>
<li>Are we opening up inside of value area? If so, observe how traders behave - do they want to take it outside of value area and explore higher, lower, or just keep it near the POC? Again, if internals aren&rsquo;t confirming a strong move up or down, then the value area high is most likely a short, and the value area low is most likely a buy. This is just responsive trading. If internals are strong enough for us to break out of value area, then a break below value area is a short, and a break above would be a buy.</li>
<li>How far of a gap down are we gapping down by? Anything around double digits is going to be a hard gap to fade unless internals are very bullish. If internals do show strong bullishness, and we try to go lower but fail and instead we take out the overnight low, I would look to target the yesterday&rsquo;s low and then after that, the value area low, the settlement, then the POC and then value area high, and then from there, yesterday&rsquo;s POC at around 2050. Watch any of these levels for a potential short as well, and watch the internals for confirmation.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. I don&rsquo;t have trade setups for tonight, but if you <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>, you will be able to see every trade that I enter, adjust, and exit, and my live market commentary.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/02/bullish-into-next-week/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-02T11:29:57-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/02/bullish-into-next-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m certain the markets will continue to climb higher next week.</p>

<p>There are just not enough sellers out there. On Friday, we were able to enter into the second distribution area from the Janet Yellen day:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-02 - Weak Sellers Failing to Take Market Lower Regardless of Poor Structure" /></a></p>

<p>But before spending enough time there, we couldn&rsquo;t find more sellers to come in. What I was expecting to happen when we broke into the second distribution area was that we at least test the 2033.5 level (and it should be relatively easy to get there due to the extremely poor structure). Obviously that didn&rsquo;t happen, and instead, on Friday during RTH, we ended up moving back up over the overnight low and through the open (which was a strong buy signal). Overnight shorts did not get paid, got nervous, and we saw the market run higher for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Is that bearish? No. Sellers are extremely nervous out there still, and looking at the tape, every time they tried to take this market lower, they completely failed, even when structurally it was easy for them to do so. So regardless of how overbought this market is right now, we should be thinking bullish into next week. We&rsquo;ll have some trade ideas presented later this weekend based around this bullish bias, but first:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/spx_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/spx_daily.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-02 - Daily - Bullish - Trendline Resistance Becomes Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how we tried to break down, but ended up finding support at what was previously the trendline resistance. A classic look below and fail pattern - <strong>pretty bullish</strong>. First target here is the top of the range extension denoted by the top right pink box, which is around 2084, followed by the next trendline resistance at around 2090, and then the even 2100.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/spx_weekly.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/spx_weekly.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>Strong momentum.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly - Breaking Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Again, strong momentum. It actually broke through the trendline resistance. Target here would be 180.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-02 - Weekly - 61.8% Fib Level Acts as Support" /></a></p>

<p>It found support off that 61.8% Fib level. Next target is that trendline resistance.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04022016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04022016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-02 - Weekly" /></a></p>

<p>Which looks like it may just plow through that trendline resistance, and if so, the next target would be back up to 1200.</p>

<p>Given the doubt that many have on how much higher this market can really run, but keeping in mind the bullish targets explained just above, I have a few options trade ideas that may work well just for this scenario. This will be done in a separate post which I will tweet out later this weekend, so stay tuned, and <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me</a> if you haven&rsquo;t already so that you&rsquo;ll know about it right when I tweet it out.</p>
