    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, we got an expansion of range yesterday, with value area gapping to the downside:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/es_5m.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/es_5m.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-30 - 5m Chart - Value Area Gapping to the Downside" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/blog/2016/04/29/yesterdays-liquidation-break-going-forward/" title="Liquidation Break Going Forward - Bulls and Bears Have Work to Do">In my premarket post on Friday morning</a>, I mentioned that it would be beneficial for the Bulls to hold value at or above the upper distribution of Thursday&rsquo;s profile, and for the Bears to maintain the continuation of selling and migrate the POC and value area lower.</p>

<p>Well, congratulations to the Bears, because they did exactly that and were able to keep trade <em>well below</em> both of Thursday&rsquo;s distributions. When the market opened, we saw the Bulls try to push price back into Thursday&rsquo;s value area, but could not even reach it before falling back down. We then tagged the POC from 4/12, and for the rest of the day, we built value in the large balance area developed from mid-March to mid-April. By the end of the day, it was clear that Friday&rsquo;s value area is a gap below Thursday&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s an expansion of range to the downside, and this generally signifies the start of a new trend (in this case, a down-trend):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/es_15m.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/es_15m.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-30 - 15m Chart - Expansion of Range Signifying Beginning of a New Trend" /></a></p>

<p>The only argument that I have against the Bears is that all of this trading seems to be of low confidence. The big rip that we saw at the end of the session tells me that shorts are nervous into the close. Still, Bulls have no confidence, either. I am, however, switching my bias from neutral to slightly bearish.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the volume composite over the past 20 days:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/es_volume_comp.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/es_volume_comp.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-30 - Volume Composite" /></a></p>

<p>Prices have a predisposition to trade near high volume nodes. They also have a tendency to reject trading around low volume nodes. In accordance with that behavior, we can see that the next target to the downside is around 2040.50. This makes sense - looking back to early April, that was where a lot of the volume traded. So again, as a downside target reference, <strong>I&rsquo;m expecting traders to explore the 2040.50 area next.</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been talking about how falling into this big balance area, <strong>we should expect to target the other side of balance at 2012</strong> if we start to see some sellers step up. Keep this target in mind going forward.</p>

<p>Below that, there are many more weak downside reference points, but I will bring them up as we get closer to them. For now, <strong>focus on the large volume node at 2040.50, and then the balance area low at 2012.</strong></p>

<p>Take this bearish move with a grain of salt, because as I mentioned earlier, all of this trading seems to be done with very low confidence.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the weeklies for the broad market indices. Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-30 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Prior to this past week, we had a green candle that failed to close the week above the trendline resistance. This past week, we confirmed that failure by taking prices lower.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-30 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Very similar to the SPX. Let&rsquo;s see if we get a continuation to the downside this coming week.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-30 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>This one, as continuously mentioned, is the weakest of the bunch and exhibits the bearishness more clearly than the other indices. Watch for a break of the 4300 level, and see how the 38% fib level holds.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04302016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04302016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-30 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Currently testing that trendline support. If that support fails, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target the upward-sloping trendline support first at around 1100.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this weekend&rsquo;s market recap and outlook. With more volatility coming back into the markets, watch out for more trades from me, which I will tweet out.

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/29/yesterdays-liquidation-break-going-forward/"/>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/29/yesterdays-liquidation-break-going-forward</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s liquidation was one which I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while and showed some signs of life from the sellers.</p>

<p>Whether or not Icahn contributed to the scare doesn&rsquo;t matter. Here&rsquo;s the current volume profile over the past 15 days:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-29 - 15d Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>By the end of the session, we managed to trade back inside the intermediate balance area. Though traders got themselves stretched too short to the downside, notice that they did so with volume and were able to form two distributions (highlighted by the pink boxes):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/es_zoomed.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/es_zoomed.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-29 - 5d Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>The profile shows that the trades that occurred at the bottom distribution happened with decent volume, almost as much as there was in the upper distribution. This is definitely an edge to the Bears. However, notice that the volume POC did not migrate lower - it remained at 2087.5 - and most of the time was spent trading up there as well.</p>

<p>Today, I want to see if the POC and value area can migrate lower. I&rsquo;d like to see some continuation of selling from the Bears before switching my bias. For now, however, the Bulls have some work to do as well, and that is to get trading back above the intermediate balance area to at least in the upper distribution. Until then, my bias is neutral.</p>

<p>Also, let&rsquo;s quickly take a look at the major market indices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve now fallen back below that trendline which we&rsquo;ve meandered back and forth between. Let&rsquo;s see if the Bears can hold it below here and show some continuation to the downside.</p>

<p>The DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now below the highs of Nov 2015. Looks like the Bulls failed to keep it above there for now.</p>

<p>The NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>That trendline resistance has played out well, and this is still the weakest of the bunch. We&rsquo;re now below that 61.8% Fib retracement, closing yesterday&rsquo;s trade below it on a wide body candle.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Still holding above the trendline support quite well. We&rsquo;ll need to see if this one will start rolling over.</p>

<p>Keep a close eye on all of these indices, and let&rsquo;s see who wins the struggle up here.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook.

    <updated>2016-04-28T05:59:13-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/28/fairest-price-to-do-business</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Taking a look at the volume profile:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04282016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04282016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-28 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday, although we ripped higher into the end, value was still mostly unchanged, with the POC hovering near 2083.5. Again, this is practically where the POC has been on Tuesday, last Friday, last Thursday, and last Monday. Regardless of trendlines and such, the transactions shown by the profile tell us that this area is the fairest price to do business.</p>

<p>Currently, /ES is trading at 2078, 13 points from yesterday&rsquo;s settle. I would like to see if value can migrate lower back into the intermediate balance area denoted by the range between 2067 and 2081.75. Will the POC develop near this Monday&rsquo;s POC? To give any edge to the Bears, we need to move value area back into this intermediate balance area and take out 2067. Currently, there is just not enough seller strength at all, so my bias remains neutral to bullish.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to see how 2083.5 plays out today. On the open, if we climb higher and tag that POC and we manage to continue trading there, then essentially nothing has changed from yesterday. If we tag that POC but fall back down and start developing value lower, that&rsquo;s an edge to the Bears. But again, that&rsquo;s if sellers step up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on more trades today as I haven&rsquo;t done much of it this week.

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/27/trading-near-prominent-point-of-control/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-27T05:43:36-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/27/trading-near-prominent-point-of-control</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning traders.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/2016/04/25/watch-for-an-upside-move/" title="Watch for an Upside Move">last post</a>, we discussed how trading near the POC from last Monday, Thursday, or Friday is very possible. We got exactly that yesterday, with another rip higher into the close as traders found themselves unable to take the market lower:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04272016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04272016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-27 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how we developed most of yesterday&rsquo;s value above 2081.75. Bias here should be neutral to slightly bullish.</p>

<p>The overnight inventory on the /ES is currently net short. We&rsquo;re currently trading around yesterday&rsquo;s POC at around <strong>2082.50</strong>, with the overnight low at <strong>2080.75</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04272016/es_reference_points.png"><img src="/images/blog/04272016/es_reference_points.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-27 - 5m Chart - Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to see how the overnight low holds - if we break below it but are unable to find more sellers and we begin trading back above it and then through the open, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target yesterday&rsquo;s value area high at <strong>2086.50</strong>, then the overnight high at <strong>2087</strong>, followed by yesterday&rsquo;s settle, which is <strong>2088.75</strong>. Again, watch for internals to confirm.</p>

<p>As for downside references, my opinion remains the same as yesterday&rsquo;s post:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I would need to see the 2067 level fail. If we close below there with signs of stronger selling, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target the other side of balance, which is down at 2012. More intermediate targets would occur along the way, but they&rsquo;ll be noted when we do break 2067.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <updated>2016-04-25T20:11:37-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/25/watch-for-an-upside-move</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Value continues to build lower:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04242016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04252016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-25 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s definitely not a bullish sign; however, just to stay alert, I wanted to point out one thing that I noticed over the past two trading sessions that has me prepared for a move back to the upside, and this is the way in which the Bears have attempted to push prices lower. You may have noticed the slow and steady grind lower during Friday&rsquo;s action and today&rsquo;s action. This has me thinking that the Bears aren&rsquo;t really confident, and they&rsquo;re struggling to push prices lower, but ultimately unable to. You can see this clearly during the past two trading sessions, where much of the grind lower gets wiped out by a big rip to the upside towards the end of each session.</p>

<p>Also, notice that today, we managed to close above the intermediate balance area high. I would not be surprised tomorrow if we hold above that level and trade near the POC from last Monday, Thursday, or Friday, which is around 2085. If so, I would consider that bullish, and would be looking to put on some type of a credit trade that captures a move into the 2100 level going forward.</p>

<p>For me to switch my bias to bearish, I would need to see the 2067 level fail. If we close below there with signs of stronger selling, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target the other side of balance, which is down at 2012. More intermediate targets would occur along the way, but they&rsquo;ll be noted when we do break 2067.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. For now, I&rsquo;m still keeping my bias neutral, but watching for any bullish/bearish signals.</p>
