    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll give a short market update on the broad market indices and then save a post later for possible trade ideas.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s price action continues to show some short-term traders here dominating. On the /ES, we tagged the single prints separating the two distributions on Friday, and then instead of pushing prices lower, we backed off and traded back upwards. This shows that shorter term traders are just trading responsively, and it also shows that they&rsquo;re just lacking confidence to push this higher or lower. Furthermore, we closed on a Doji today, so another reason we&rsquo;ve got a low confidence market.</p>

<p>SPX is still on track to tag the 2060 level, though to me, the market feels really heavy, and we might not get there. Watch for a possible reversal or breakout tomorrow, as we basically spent the whole day today balancing thus forming that Doji:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Doji" /></a></p>

<p>NDX crept higher today, and will probably slowly float upwards to the 61.8% fib level:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target 61.8% Fibonacci ~ 4415" /></a></p>

<p>DJX also looks like it wants to tag that trendline resistance:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>RUT here kind of stalling. Continue to monitor that trendline to see if we break it to the upside or fail back down:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Continue to monitor the markets closely. Again, I feel like traders are just tired of pushing prices higher, but we also have Janet stepping up to the mic on Wednesday, so be careful and trade cautiously.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/12/thoughts-on-the-market/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-12T12:14:17-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/12/thoughts-on-the-market</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I have not participated as much as I should have in the rally from the February lows.</p>

<p>In hindsight, that is the biggest mistake I&rsquo;ve made this year. It was clearly a double bottom, and when fueled by short-covering, became a very powerful rally. All I had to do was go long the market, or any stock for that matter, and I would&rsquo;ve been able to capture a lot more gains. Instead, I focused on the points that the market could possibly stall and turn around to go lower, and I was prepared to short at those points. And because I was so focused on preparing to short, I did not think about going long.</p>

<p>Obviously, that type of thinking has caused me a lot of lost opportunities. So, in order to correct this behavior, and to help set it in stone, I think it&rsquo;s beneficial for me to write out these thoughts so that I can come back here whenever similar situations occur in the future and set myself straight.</p>

<p>As much as I&rsquo;m punishing myself for missing out on the rally, my sentiment on the market still remains - I don&rsquo;t believe in the rally that we&rsquo;ve had from the February lows. That does not mean I won&rsquo;t be taking advantage of any bullish signals and trading them. It simply means, fundamentally, I don&rsquo;t believe our economy is any better. I believe our central bankers will run out of juice one day. At some point, the market has to correct, and I just don&rsquo;t see us making new highs in our current conditions.</p>

<p>Take a look at some of the famous, big-name stocks like FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, CMG, AAPL, etc. I would&rsquo;ve expected these stocks to rally a lot higher in conjunction with the SPX - at least if it had done so, it would&rsquo;ve shown that risk was back on. Instead, they all look very weak; it doesn&rsquo;t seem like investors are all that excited about these stocks anymore. Furthermore, it appears we&rsquo;ve rotated to defensive sector stocks like energy, and based off of what? Crude oil&rsquo;s fundamentals being better? I don&rsquo;t think so. In fact, I have no idea.</p>

<p>We started this year at 2038.2 in the SPX. We&rsquo;re currently at 2022.19. If we breach 2038.2 with vigor, I believe the next point of resistance is 2060 (highlighted by the gray oval):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03122016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03122016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-12 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060" /></a></p>

<p>Because a lot of overhead supply is above us, I think it makes sense that we won&rsquo;t be surging sharply higher - instead, we&rsquo;ll probably slowly float upwards. So I&rsquo;ll leave you with a trade idea: the 2055/2060/2070 unbalanced butterfly (currently priced for 0.15 cr) expiring March:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03122016/spx_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03122016/spx_risk_graph.png" alt="SPX Unbalanced Butterly - Risk Graph" /></a></p>

<p>The max loss here is the 5.00 - .15, or $485 per spread.</p>

<p>This will need to be price-discovered again on Monday. If the credit is still good, and if the SPX looks like it&rsquo;s going to be slowly grinding higher, I would put this trade on.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Enjoy the weekend everyone.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/11/further-upside-expected/"/>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/11/further-upside-expected</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m expecting further upside in the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday after the ECB announcement, traders attempted to push the market lower but were unable to do so. We looked below balance, failed, made a poor low, and then came back into balance. Then this morning, we gapped up, but with the internals so strong, no chance of a gap fade play was available, and we continued to ratchet higher.</p>

<p>This is a very bullish signal, regardless of how overbought the conditions are. Here&rsquo;s the current SPX chart:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03112016/spx_daily.png"><img src="/images/blog/03112016/spx_daily.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance, Range Extension" /></a></p>

<p>For those that took a bullish stance on the market during that time, congratulations. In the first SPX chart that I posted a couple of weeks back, I outlined the potential range extension we could see as possible target areas (via the pink rectangles). This week, not only did we break the 61.8% fib level, but we&rsquo;ve also broken the trendline resistance connected by the tops of November and December 2015. I believe we&rsquo;re headed to 2060. So if you&rsquo;re long, continue to hold that position.</p>

<p>Zooming out and taking a look at the market on the weekly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03112016/spx_weekly.png"><img src="/images/blog/03112016/spx_weekly.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-11 Weekly Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance, Range Extension, Bottoming-Tail Hammer" /></a></p>

<p>Notice the bottoming tail hammer that formed. I count many weekly bars from before that ended with a higher close the following week.</p>

<p>The same bullishness can be seen in the Dow:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03112016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03112016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re approaching the trendline resistance here as well. Look for a short there. As a side note, DJX has also put in a bottoming-tail hammer on the weekly chart.</p>

<p>For the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03112016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03112016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>A little bit weaker here, as we have not tagged the 61.8% fib level, yet. Still, this has also put in a bottoming-tail hammer on the weekly chart.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03112016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03112016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-11 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Trendline Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>Though it exhibited a lot of weakness a couple of days ago, keep in mind it has come off really high from the lows. It looks like it&rsquo;ll break that trendline resistance, and if it does, that&rsquo;ll suggest more short-covering to come.</p>

<p>That about wraps it up for the week going on to next week. I&rsquo;d just like to finish with another note:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not bullish on the market - I think the fundamentals are complete garbage, and I think we&rsquo;ll see a crash like we&rsquo;ve never seen before. However, I can&rsquo;t let my biases blind me from seeing the opportunities out there. Instead of falling prey to cognitive dissonance, we can separate our bias and take advantage of these opportunities as they come.</p>

<p>Enjoy the weekend, and good luck to everyone, bull or bear.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All broad market indices traded lower today.</p>

<p>SPX erases the past 3 days of trading:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>NDX continues to form lower Dojis:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>DJX forms a swing high:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>RUT forms a swing high and had the biggest drop in % today.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>This could be the start of a new (down) trend, but given how nervous traders are out there, I would not be surprised if we gap up tomorrow; thus, monitor the markets for a continued move down.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of bearish trades that may pan out if the market continues to roll over:</p>

<p>/CL erased all of its gains from yesterday - this is quite bearish. Look for a break below 36. If sellers start coming in hard, then we&rsquo;ve got a &ldquo;look above and fail&rdquo; pattern, which would be a short signal. Keep a close eye on this.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/cl_f.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/cl_f.png" alt="/CL - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement and Harmonic Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>CMG exhibited a dark cloud cover pattern today, with a double top on the daily, and a small topping tail. The APR 600/610 call spread is currently trading for 0.97 cr.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png" alt="CMG - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement, Dark Cloud Cover, Double Top" /></a></p>

<p>TRIP has been a bit confused about where it wanted to go for the previous 4 days before today. Today&rsquo;s price action broke us out of a rising wedge. If bearishness continues, we can easily head to the lower 50s.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/cmg.png" alt="TRIP - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Rising Wedge" /></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck in the markets tomorrow. Stay small, and stay safe.</p>

    <updated>2016-03-07T13:42:40-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/03/07/indices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The markets continue to grind higher, with the SPX closing today above the 61.8% fib level. The likely target is the descending trendline resistance, which should be around 2020:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03072016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Descending Trendline Resistance &amp; Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the DJX, it has also closed above the 61.8% fib level:
<a href="/images/blog/03072016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Descending Trendline Resistance and Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Of course, the strongest of them all, RUT, grinds higher:
<a href="/images/blog/03072016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Ascending Trendline Support as Resistance and Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>And then, interestingly enough the NDX, which has been having a hard time getting some love:
<a href="/images/blog/03072016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Whatever the case, it looks like the markets are mostly pointing to being neutral or moving higher. Unless the Bears have more confidence, this market will most likely continue to meander up here, dominated by many short term traders. Look for yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea on the market for ideas on trade location.</p>

<p>Moving over to /CL.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03072016/cl_f.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/cl_f.png" alt="/CL - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement and Harmonic Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>/CL is approaching its previous resistance levels, as well as the 50% fib level (Oct - Feb). Furthermore, a <a href="http://www.harmonictrader.com/price_patternsabcd.htm" title="harmonic pattern">harmonic pattern AB=CD</a> could be forming again (we saw one form from last May to last August, and a completion of the pattern from last October to last month). If we do see crude oil begin to roll over, we can initiate a short position, giving us a good trade location. However, for confirmation, I&rsquo;d like to see it trade below 35 again before shorting. For now, do keep an eye out on /CL.</p>

<p>For those that are a bit more aggressive, you may consider selling a call vertical here on /CL. The MAY 42/42.5 call spread (39 DTE) is trading for .15 cr currently, or the 42/43 call spread, currently trading for .28 cr.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today, happy trading out there, and enjoy the markets tomorrow.</p>
