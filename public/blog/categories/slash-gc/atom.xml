    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hope everyone had a great Memorial weekend!</p>

<p>Today we placed a couple of new trades, one of them being on Gold:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BOT BUTTERFLY /GCQ6 1/100 JUL 16 /OGN6 (27) 1150/1135/1110 P at .20</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/737632334749388800">May 31, 2016</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the daily chart for /GC:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05312016/gc.png"><img src="/images/blog/05312016/gc.png" alt="/GC - 2016-05-31 - Daily Chart - Channel Support &amp; Analog Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an analog between the first break of the channel &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; and where /GC low-based (first pink rectangle), and where we just broke below that channel &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; later again at a higher price and where we may be low-basing going forward (right pink rectangle). We can expect the channel support to hold, and personally I will be long gold anywhere along that trendline. But for now, as long as /GC nears 1150 by expiration, we should be closing this trade out for a profit when the opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>This trade was posted live on Twitter this morning, and we&rsquo;ll be managing it together there as well.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I mentioned a possible long/short trade on AUD/JPY depending on how we close today. Unfortunately for the Bull case, we weren&rsquo;t able to close above that lower price level. Still for the Bear case, I&rsquo;d like to see us breach the 85 level before initiating a short, so this is still a wait-and-see.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/aud_jpy.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/aud_jpy.png" alt="AUD/JPY - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame " /></a></p>

<p>I also mentioned shorting natural gas if UNG floats up to the price level shown here:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/ung.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/ung.png" alt="UNG - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame" /></a></p>

<p>We did not get that today, so this is also still a wait-and-see.</p>

<p>Looking at /GC, we&rsquo;ve stalled since ECB, and we&rsquo;re currently testing some trendline support levels:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/gc_f.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/gc_f.png" alt="/GC - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Target 1200 Support" /></a></p>

<p>If we do break lower, I&rsquo;d imagine the next level of support is around 1200, and if so, we could easily reach that target within the next 2 weeks. One trade idea here is the 1210/1200/1185 unbalanced butterfly:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/gc_f_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/gc_f_risk_graph.png" alt="/GC Risk Graph - 1210/1200/1185 Put Unbalanced Butterfly - Max Profit at 1200" /></a></p>

<p>This trade can basically be put on for free or even for a credit, but will need to be managed in case gold does plunge back down hard. I will be monitoring /GC and will be tweeting out my entry.</p>

<p>Another one is BIDU:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/bidu.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/bidu.png" alt="BIDU - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Topping-Tail Hammer" /></a></p>

<p>Below 178.92 is a short, but I&rsquo;ll be watching FXI for follow through as well:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03142016/fxi.png"><img src="/images/blog/03142016/fxi.png" alt="FXI - 2016-03-14 Daily Time Frame - Resistance" /></a></p>

<p>If FXI stalls at that resistance, I&rsquo;ll be looking to sell some call spreads on BIDU. One trade idea is the 200/205 call spread, currently going for 1.03 cr.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Probably everyone and their mothers have already gotten the memo to buy Gold. I don&rsquo;t want to be jumping on the bandwagon because everyone else is, but because technical analysis points to further upside potential. Observe the chart of /GC below:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_out.png"><img src="/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_out.png" alt="/GC" /></a></p>

<p>Gold has had a massive rally ever since the rounded bottom formed during the end of last year. On Feb 10-11 when the market double bottomed, we saw /GC put in a high, but even as the broad market rallied, /GC hasn&rsquo;t fallen much; instead, it consolidated and formed a wedge, and then towards the end of last week, it broke up and out of that wedge:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_in.png"><img src="/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_zoomed_in.png" alt="/GC" /></a></p>

<p>As such, we can expect this break out to continue to trend upwards. Any failure to maintain this new uptrend should be considered bearish, since that would be a classic &ldquo;look above and fail&rdquo; pattern.</p>

<p>For those that would like to take a theta-positive trade on this instrument, consider selling naked puts (perhaps at the 0.05 delta).</p>

<p>Another strategy that collects more premium but has upside risk is selling a strangle to finance a vertical debit call spread. One idea is to buy the 1300/1325 call spread, and finance it by selling the 1175/1375 strangle. This is currently trading for about 0.20 cr, so even after commissions, this trade can be put on for &ldquo;free.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the risk graph:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03062016/gc_f_risk_graph.png" alt="/GC" /></a></p>

<p>This trade has about a 71% probability of success, with the breakeven at 1400 to the upside (which lines up nicely with a previous horizontal resistance) and a bit below 1175 to the downside. Management is key here, as risk is unlimited - make sure to roll up/down and out in duration if the strikes are being threatened.</p>

<p>You can also consider legging into this position, if you believe that /GC will make a quick run up first. In that case, consider selling the naked put and buying the call spread, but leaving the naked call to be placed at a later time. Finding the right credit for these setups may be harder, but if you have the edge of technical analysis, you may not always need to place trades for a credit initially.</p>

<p>As always, stay small, and trade safely.</p>
