    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a tremendous rally yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05112016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05112016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-11 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile &amp; 20d Composite" /></a></p>

<p>Profile is a bit stretched and volume a bit low; regardless, the edge here is clearly to the Bulls. <a href="/blog/2016/05/10/mind-the-hvns/" title="Mind the HVNs">As mentioned yesterday morning</a>, for the Bulls, we were looking for a move to near one of the HVNs, either 2075 or 2085. We got that first one, with yesterday&rsquo;s POC right at 2074.50, so the next target now is 2085.</p>

<p>Bias here is now slightly bullish. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see some consolidation or retracement here before we continue the movement higher. However, an entire retracement of yesterday&rsquo;s upmove puts yesterday&rsquo;s rally into question, so watch out for that as well.</p>

<p>I mentioned I would place some trades near the HVNs of 2075 and 2085, but due to lack of good pricing, I wasn&rsquo;t able to find one. However, I&rsquo;ll still be looking for some, possibly to the downside as well, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s market outlook.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s trade was very evenly distributed around the POC, with a small value area range, so it was a fairly decent balance day:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05102016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05102016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-10 - 5m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Traders were able to find acceptance back in the upper distributions of last Thursday&rsquo;s and Friday&rsquo;s trade. They managed to build value higher, albeit overlapping, thus not really a sign of any momentum. Again, we&rsquo;re seeing low confidence as traders have no idea where to go from here.</p>

<p>/ES is currently trading at 2062. Overnight inventory is net long. On an intraday basis, when we open, watch the internals and see if the $TICKs have a hard time reaching 0. That will tell you whether or not there is a gap fade play. If the $TICK quickly shoots downwards, here are some downside targets for the gap fade:</p>

<ol>
<li>yesterday&rsquo;s high at 2057.75</li>
<li>value area high at 2056.75</li>
<li>POC at 2054</li>
<li>value area low 2051.50</li>
<li>yesterday&rsquo;s low at 2048.25</li>
</ol>


<p>Note the High Volume Nodes (HVN) at around <strong>2051</strong>, <strong>2075</strong>, and <strong>2085</strong>. Remember that prices tend to get pulled in those directions. With the /ES currently at 2062 (low volume node), expect prices to migrate away from here and possibly find acceptance near one of the HVNs.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook.
