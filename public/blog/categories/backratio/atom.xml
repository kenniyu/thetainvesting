    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re fans of the naked put - an option that allows us to buy the underlying at a price that we deem reasonable, while collecting some premium during the process. But sometimes, we want to capture more gains to the upside. In this case, we can consider putting on some kind of a spread that, over time, allows us to make money if the underlying goes up.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at $MCD as an example:</p>

<h3 id="20170204-mcd">$MCD</h3>


<p><a href="/images/blog/20170204/mcd.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170204/mcd.png" alt="MCD - 2017-02-04 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the chart of $MCD - obviously quite bullish. With earnings aside and the trendline resistance broken, $MCD has room to run back to the all time highs of 132. If we want to capture a move to 132, a 130/135 call backratio spread would net us about 2.00 in profit (per spread). This spread alone costs a slight debit, but if our overall bias on $MCD is bullish, we can finance it with a naked put at a price level which we deem reasonable to buy stock. Given that the 200 period moving average is around 118, we can look to sell a put option slightly below that, or the 115 put option.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the trade setup comes out to selling the 115 put option, and buying the 130 call option, and selling two times the 135 call option, all expiring in March:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/20170204/mcdoc.png"><img src="/images/blog/20170204/mcdoc.png" alt="MCD Risk Graph- 2017-02-04 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>IF $MCD manages to go higher and stay between $115 and $140 by expiration, we&rsquo;ll be profitable (90% chance of happening). And if it lands anywhere near 135 by expiration, we&rsquo;ll get to make roughly 5.00, or $500. Putting on this spread allows us to collect .17 in credit. Essentially, we get paid $17 to make roughly $500. That should cover a whole year&rsquo;s worth of eating at McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Congratulations if you took that trade with me!</p>

<p>The other trades currently look good still. To see the most recent risk graphs on our open positions, check out the <a href="/trades" title="Trades">Trades page</a>.

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with one trade idea for tomorrow. We&rsquo;ve been putting on quite some trades, so its wise we have time each day to manage each as necessary (though not a lot of management has been necessary so far for many of our trades).</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a trade idea on LNKD:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png"><img src="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png" alt="LNKD - 2016-03-28 Range-Bound" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m expecting for the stock to slowly grind lower or meander in between the 100 to 125 price range. If it does manage to get down to 100, I&rsquo;m expecting a bounce to occur, as it has been a while since we&rsquo;ve tested that prior support level. Because of these reasons, I think a put backratio would allow us to capture profits on a slow move down, as well as any moves up. Here is the 105/102 put backratio in APR:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd_risk_graph.png"><img src="/images/blog/03282016/lnkd_risk_graph.png" alt="LNKD Risk Graph - 2016-03-28 Put Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>We have big downside risk, so management is key here. We may be able to turn this into a cheap butterfly later as well, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. If you haven&rsquo;t yet, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to receive my trade entries and adjustments in real time.</p>
