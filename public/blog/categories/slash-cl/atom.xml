<p>RUT forms a swing high and had the biggest drop in % today.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03082016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/03082016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-03-08 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>This could be the start of a new (down) trend, but given how nervous traders are out there, I would not be surprised if we gap up tomorrow; thus, monitor the markets for a continued move down.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple of bearish trades that may pan out if the market continues to roll over:</p>

<p>/CL erased all of its gains from yesterday - this is quite bearish. Look for a break below 36. If sellers start coming in hard, then we&rsquo;ve got a &ldquo;look above and fail&rdquo; pattern, which would be a short signal. Keep a close eye on this.</p>

<p>CMG exhibited a dark cloud cover pattern today, with a double top on the daily, and a small topping tail. The APR 600/610 call spread is currently trading for 0.97 cr.</p>

<p>TRIP has been a bit confused about where it wanted to go for the previous 4 days before today. Today&rsquo;s price action broke us out of a rising wedge. If bearishness continues, we can easily head to the lower 50s.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck in the markets tomorrow. Stay small, and stay safe.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The markets continue to grind higher, with the SPX closing today above the 61.8% fib level. The likely target is the descending trendline resistance, which should be around 2020:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03072016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Descending Trendline Resistance &amp; Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Looking at the DJX, it has also closed above the 61.8% fib level:

<p>Of course, the strongest of them all, RUT, grinds higher:

<p>And then, interestingly enough the NDX, which has been having a hard time getting some love:
<a href="/images/blog/03072016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement" /></a></p>

<p>Whatever the case, it looks like the markets are mostly pointing to being neutral or moving higher. Unless the Bears have more confidence, this market will most likely continue to meander up here, dominated by many short term traders. Look for yesterday&rsquo;s trade idea on the market for ideas on trade location.</p>

<p>Moving over to /CL.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/03072016/cl_f.png"><img src="/images/blog/03072016/cl_f.png" alt="/CL - 2016-03-07 Daily Time Frame - Fibonacci Retracement and Harmonic Pattern" /></a></p>

<p>/CL is approaching its previous resistance levels, as well as the 50% fib level (Oct - Feb). Furthermore, a <a href="http://www.harmonictrader.com/price_patternsabcd.htm" title="harmonic pattern">harmonic pattern AB=CD</a> could be forming again (we saw one form from last May to last August, and a completion of the pattern from last October to last month). If we do see crude oil begin to roll over, we can initiate a short position, giving us a good trade location. However, for confirmation, I&rsquo;d like to see it trade below 35 again before shorting. For now, do keep an eye out on /CL.</p>

<p>For those that are a bit more aggressive, you may consider selling a call vertical here on /CL. The MAY 42/42.5 call spread (39 DTE) is trading for .15 cr currently, or the 42/43 call spread, currently trading for .28 cr.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today, happy trading out there, and enjoy the markets tomorrow.</p>
