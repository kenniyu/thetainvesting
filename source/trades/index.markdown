- *04-04-2016* - This is moving our direction - we continue to hold

- *04-06-2016* - This ran up hard, but we continue to hold
- *04-07-2016* - Continue to hold
- *04-08-2016* - This ran up hard again, but we'll just let this expire worthless - not worth the commission costs to close, and the margin requirement should be significantly lower by Sunday anyway.
- *04-11-2016 - present* - This will most likely expire worthless, but holding on for any miracle move down

**Closing:** *pending*

**Notes:**

- *03-23-2016* - This stock has never been good to me, and we actually had a pretty solid gap-fill and continuation. People just got too overly short this stock yesterday.
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *03-31-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-01-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-04-2016* - We turned this into an IC today - just hedging the call spread
- *04-05-2016* - Looking terrible. This just rallies harder every day, but will continue holding for now
- *04-06-2016* - We closed out our bear call spread for a huge debit today unfortunately to avoid being assigned early on the deep ITM call. We then sold a naked put and a naked call to collect some more premium. So far, this trade is currently NOT profitable by expiration unless we make more adjustments. For now, we continue to hold and see where the next 9 days takes us.
- *04-07-2016* - Nothing much happened today. We continue to hold
- *04-08-2016* - A huge drop today - we continue to hold
- *04-11-2016 - 04-12-2016* - We continue to hold
- *04-13-2016* - The premium is really starting to come in - continue to hold

- *04-13-2016* - We held this for a while, but could not get to a profitable enough state to exit. Instead, markets continue grinding higher, so we had to roll this out to May

**Closing:** *pending*

**Notes:**

- *03-22-2016* - Would like more bearishness here, but at least we have time decay helping us.
- *03-30-2016* - This is not moving in our direction, but there is still time left here.
- *03-31-2016* - It's not moving strongly to the upside, so still a hold
- *04-01-2016* - Still not moving enough to the downside, but still holding
- *04-04-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-05-2016* - This moved in our direction today. We need more, though. Continue to hold
- *04-06-2016* - More downside today - we continue to hold
- *04-07-2016* - We continue to hold.
- *04-08-2016 - present* - We continue to hold. This just appears to be moving sideways. We just can't seem to have this move down, so may sell some naked puts in here going forward.

**Notes:**

- *03-21-2016* - This is very far from our center, but we put this on for a credit so no problem here.
- *03-30-2016 - present* - No updates. This is so far from our short strike, will let it expire worthless if anything (feel free to take it off to free up BP)
