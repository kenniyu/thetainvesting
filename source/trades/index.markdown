- *04-19-2016* - SOLD **UNG** 100 MAY 16 6.5 PUT **@.15**

**Notes:**

- *03-22-2016* - Would like more bearishness here, but at least we have time decay helping us.
- *03-30-2016* - This is not moving in our direction, but there is still time left here.
- *03-31-2016* - It's not moving strongly to the upside, so still a hold
- *04-01-2016* - Still not moving enough to the downside, but still holding
- *04-04-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-05-2016* - This moved in our direction today. We need more, though. Continue to hold
- *04-06-2016* - More downside today - we continue to hold
- *04-07-2016* - We continue to hold.
- *04-08-2016 - 04-18-2016* - We continue to hold. This just appears to be moving sideways. We just can't seem to have this move down, so may sell some naked puts in here going forward.
- *04-19-2016* - Apologies on this trade - this should've been rolled yesterday but I totally missed it, and now we're rolling at a worse cost. I'm thinking since this has closed above a consolidation area put in over the past few weeks, we will need to adjust our deltas here.
- *04-20-2016 - present* - Holding on
