**Notes:**

- *03-23-2016* - Looks like it may stall here for a while.
- *03-29-2016* - Selling another unit of the 18.5 put, now the 19.5/18.5 is a 1x2 put backratio
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *03-31-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-01-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-04-2016* - Looking for a bit more of a downmove - we continue to hold
- *04-05-2016* - Selling another 18.5 put here. We want GDX to move down here anyway and we don't have much time left.
- *04-06-2016* - We continue to hold
- *04-07-2016* - We rolled our call strike up and out to May and rolled one unit of our puts out to May as well.
- *04-08-2016* - We continue to hold
- *04-11-2016* - We rolled up the put side of our strangle in May to neutralize some deltas, and we'll just wait
- *04-12-2016 - 04-18-2016* - We continue to hold, letting duration work for us.
- *04-19-2016* - We made an adjustment in this today to neutralize some deltas. Though we are adding more risk to the downside here, we actually *want* this to move back down to our put strikes.
- *04-20-2016 - 04-28-2016* - Holding on
- *04-29-2016* - Made more delta adjustments today - we are inverted in our position now, with an extra unit for the puts side
- *05-02-2016 - present* - Holding

**Notes:**

- *03-22-2016* - Would like more bearishness here, but at least we have time decay helping us.
- *03-30-2016* - This is not moving in our direction, but there is still time left here.
- *03-31-2016* - It's not moving strongly to the upside, so still a hold
- *04-01-2016* - Still not moving enough to the downside, but still holding
- *04-04-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-05-2016* - This moved in our direction today. We need more, though. Continue to hold
- *04-06-2016* - More downside today - we continue to hold
- *04-07-2016* - We continue to hold.
- *04-08-2016 - 04-18-2016* - We continue to hold. This just appears to be moving sideways. We just can't seem to have this move down, so may sell some naked puts in here going forward.
- *04-19-2016* - Apologies on this trade - this should've been rolled yesterday but I totally missed it, and now we're rolling at a worse cost. I'm thinking since this has closed above a consolidation area put in over the past few weeks, we will need to adjust our deltas here.
- *04-20-2016 - present* - Holding on
