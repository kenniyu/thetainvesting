Here are some trade ideas for the coming week:

**/CL:**

[![/CL - 2016-12-03 - Daily - Volume Profile & Trendlines](/images/blog/12032016/cl_f.png)](/images/blog/12032016/cl_f.png)
Note the rally and pullback from August to September. In terms of distance and days, we are seeing roughly the same pattern here from November to December, possibly.

Also note HVN at 46 - if we see some resistance and a pullback, possible magnet area would be 46.

We could put on a cheap balanced butterfly to capture a grind back down into the 46 area, over the next 12 days (in alignment with the retracement period back in September):

Going for about .08 debit. Not bad.


**/6E:**

The down move has been slightly overextended. If you're expecting a pullback, but are concerned that the Bears are still in control, here's an idea, expiring this coming week:

[![/6E - 2016-12-03 - Broken Wing Butterfly Risk Graph](/images/blog/12032016/6e_f_bwb.png)](/images/blog/12032016/6e_f_bwb.png)

A call-side broken wing butterfly with max profit at 1.08. The mark is a bit off right now, so will probably have to wait til Sunday night to get a more accurate pricing on this.

Enjoy the weekend, and good trading next week!
