We love looking for consolidation patterns and trading with the trend. One particular candidate that fits these criteria is $COF. Please observe the chart below.

$COF has been consolidating after a huge move to the upside. With the recent breakout in the financials ETF $XLF, we're looking for continued upside. We'll look to get long at a break above yesterday's high: 89.59. Our stop loss will be a close below 85.24, as we're expecting the 50MA to hold, but giving ourself some room for noise. And as long as trend holds, we continue holding this long.
