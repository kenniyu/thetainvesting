[![/ES - 2016-05-12 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile & 20d Composite](/images/blog/05122016/es.png)](/images/blog/05122016/es.png)

On Wednesday, we had an entire retracement of Tuesday's rally. [In the blog post yesterday](/blog/2016/05/11/expecting-consolidation-before-next-hvn-at-2085/ "Expecting Consolidation Before Next HVN at 2085"), we mentioned that if we did see that, it puts the rally in question. All of this just goes to show the low confidence that traders have in the market. If we were in a high confidence market, you wouldn't see a rally give back like this. You would see a slight pullback or pause, before a continuation higher. You would definitely see things trend more easily without value areas grinding slowly in one direction, overlapping the previous day's. And you would definitely see more volume. Last week it felt like the Bears couldn't get a good momentum to the downside, and now, the Bulls can't seem to hold up their end either.

I'm going to have to remain neutral here, keeping focus on the HVNs at 2075 and 2085 on the upside, and 2050 on the downside. As of the time of this writing, /ES is trading at 2069, which is within yesterday's value area. I would not be surprised if we continue to build value here.

As always, keep putting on theta and vega positive positions. And if you haven't already, make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to receive my tweets in real time. I'll be posting all of my trade entries, adjustments, and exits.

Good luck in the markets today!
