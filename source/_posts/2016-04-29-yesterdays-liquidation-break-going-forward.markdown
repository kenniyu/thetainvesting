Yesterday's liquidation was one which I haven't seen in a while and showed some signs of life from the sellers.

Whether or not Icahn contributed to the scare doesn't matter. Here's the current volume profile over the past 15 days:

By the end of the session, we managed to trade back inside the intermediate balance area. Though traders got themselves stretched too short to the downside, notice that they did so with volume and were able to form two distributions (highlighted by the pink boxes):

The profile shows that the trades that occurred at the bottom distribution happened with decent volume, almost as much as there was in the upper distribution. This is definitely an edge to the Bears. However, notice that the volume POC did not migrate lower - it remained at 2087.5 - and most of the time was spent trading up there as well.

Today, I want to see if the POC and value area can migrate lower. I'd like to see some continuation of selling from the Bears before switching my bias. For now, however, the Bulls have some work to do as well, and that is to get trading back above the intermediate balance area to at least in the upper distribution. Until then, my bias is neutral.

Also, let's quickly take a look at the major market indices.

Here's the SPX:

We've now fallen back below that trendline which we've meandered back and forth between. Let's see if the Bears can hold it below here and show some continuation to the downside.

The DJX:

We're now below the highs of Nov 2015. Looks like the Bulls failed to keep it above there for now.

The NDX:

That trendline resistance has played out well, and this is still the weakest of the bunch. We're now below that 61.8% Fib retracement, closing yesterday's trade below it on a wide body candle.

Here's the RUT:

Still holding above the trendline support quite well. We'll need to see if this one will start rolling over.

Keep a close eye on all of these indices, and let's see who wins the struggle up here.
