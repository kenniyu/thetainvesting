If you're looking for a chance to get long $AAPL, and possibly make money on the downside, one way is to take advantage of the upcoming earnings.

Here's the current chart of $AAPL on the daily:

The 200MA is a nice place to go long. One way to make money if we get a downside move to the 110 area after earnings is to play a Feb 115/110 put backratio:

This will only cost you a 0.16 debit, pretty cheap!

So if $AAPL expires at 110 at expiration, not only will you get to own the stock (100 shares per backratio you put on), but you'll also make an additional 4.84 per spread, or $484 per spread (less commissions).
