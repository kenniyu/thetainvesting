Yesterday I mentioned a possible long/short trade on AUD/JPY depending on how we close today. Unfortunately for the Bull case, we weren't able to close above that lower price level. Still for the Bear case, I'd like to see us breach the 85 level before initiating a short, so this is still a wait-and-see.

I also mentioned shorting natural gas if UNG floats up to the price level shown here:

We did not get that today, so this is also still a wait-and-see.

Looking at /GC, we've stalled since ECB, and we're currently testing some trendline support levels:

If we do break lower, I'd imagine the next level of support is around 1200, and if so, we could easily reach that target within the next 2 weeks. One trade idea here is the 1210/1200/1185 unbalanced butterfly:

This trade can basically be put on for free or even for a credit, but will need to be managed in case gold does plunge back down hard. I will be monitoring /GC and will be tweeting out my entry.

Another one is BIDU:

Below 178.92 is a short, but I'll be watching FXI for follow through as well:

If FXI stalls at that resistance, I'll be looking to sell some call spreads on BIDU. One trade idea is the 200/205 call spread, currently going for 1.03 cr.

That's it for today. <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">Follow me on Twitter</a> to get my real-time updates on my entries and positions.
