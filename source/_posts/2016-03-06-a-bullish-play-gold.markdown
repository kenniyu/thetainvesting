Probably everyone and their mothers have already gotten the memo to buy Gold. I don't want to be jumping on the bandwagon because everyone else is, but because technical analysis points to further upside potential. Observe the chart of /GC below:

Gold has had a massive rally ever since the rounded bottom formed during the end of last year. On Feb 10-11 when the market double bottomed, we saw /GC put in a high, but even as the broad market rallied, /GC hasn't fallen much; instead, it consolidated and formed a wedge, and then towards the end of last week, it broke up and out of that wedge:

As such, we can expect this break out to continue to trend upwards. Any failure to maintain this new uptrend should be considered bearish, since that would be a classic "look above and fail" pattern.

For those that would like to take a theta-positive trade on this instrument, consider selling naked puts (perhaps at the 0.05 delta).

Another strategy that collects more premium but has upside risk is selling a strangle to finance a vertical debit call spread. One idea is to buy the 1300/1325 call spread, and finance it by selling the 1175/1375 strangle. This is currently trading for about 0.20 cr, so even after commissions, this trade can be put on for "free." Here's the risk graph:

This trade has about a 71% probability of success, with the breakeven at 1400 to the upside (which lines up nicely with a previous horizontal resistance) and a bit below 1175 to the downside. Management is key here, as risk is unlimited - make sure to roll up/down and out in duration if the strikes are being threatened.

You can also consider legging into this position, if you believe that /GC will make a quick run up first. In that case, consider selling the naked put and buying the call spread, but leaving the naked call to be placed at a later time. Finding the right credit for these setups may be harder, but if you have the edge of technical analysis, you may not always need to place trades for a credit initially.

As always, stay small, and trade safely.
