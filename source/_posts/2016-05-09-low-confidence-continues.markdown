Last Friday we formed two distributions:

[![/ES - 2016-05-09 - 5m Chart - Volume Profile](/images/blog/05092016/es.png)](/images/blog/05092016/es.png)

Traders took the market back up to the upper distribution formed on Thursday.

Overall, the market last week moved lower, but did so with a bit of a forced action. Ultimately traders found themselves unable to take the market much lower in multiple sessions, and by the end of these sessions, we saw an end of the day rally. Furthermore, value areas were mostly overlapping throughout last week, meaning it seemed hard for the Bears to get any sort of momentum to the downside or a trend going at all. All of this spells low confidence to me.

I'm remaining neutral going into this week until things change. For downside targets, I'll be watching last week's RTH low at 2033.75 and overnight low at 2030.50 to see how those hold. For upside targets, we have high volume nodes at around 2075 and 2085. If we have any sort of a rally, I'll be looking to put on a trade that captures a move into those areas, for a credit.

Here is a brief look at the major market indices on the weekly.

SPX:

Still holding below trendline resistance, and has room to fall to the downside to the 38% Fib.

DJX:

This one is holding well above the trendline support.

NDX:

As the weakest of the bunch, it's spent a long time grinding lower and is holding above the 50% Fib.

RUT:

Just closed below the trendline resistance last week. Let's see how that trendline acts as resistance this week, however.

That's it for this weekend/morning market outlook. We'll be doing more trade adjustments today, so as always, make sure to [follow me there](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to receive tweets about our trades in real-time.
