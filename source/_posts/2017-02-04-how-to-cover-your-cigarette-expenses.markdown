This year, the [tobacco industry has already shown a 8.3% return on investment](http://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=210&o=-perf1w "Top Performing Sectors - 8.3% Return on Tobacco Products Sector"). We're looking for this trend to continue. One stock in this industry is Philip Morris - the largest cigarette manufacturer in America. Please observe the chart below:

PM is in a strong uptrend, breaking the 200MA and very far from the 20MA. We're now exploring the upper balance area set from 2016. Given the strong industry, how earnings has already passed, and that we're now in this upper range of balance and expect it to stay within this range, we're looking to collect premium in a favorable buy spot around the 200MA at $95.

Going over to the option chain and selecting the 95 Put strike in March:

With the bid at .34 and the ask at .41, we can look to sell this option for around .37. Essentially we could collect about $37 by March expiration. Hey, that covers the cost of about 6 or 7 cigarette packs. Although if you're smoking this much a month, you should really consider cutting back, for the sake of your health.
