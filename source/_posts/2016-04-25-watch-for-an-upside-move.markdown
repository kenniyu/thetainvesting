Value continues to build lower:

That's definitely not a bullish sign; however, just to stay alert, I wanted to point out one thing that I noticed over the past two trading sessions that has me prepared for a move back to the upside, and this is the way in which the Bears have attempted to push prices lower. You may have noticed the slow and steady grind lower during Friday's action and today's action. This has me thinking that the Bears aren't really confident, and they're struggling to push prices lower, but ultimately unable to. You can see this clearly during the past two trading sessions, where much of the grind lower gets wiped out by a big rip to the upside towards the end of each session.

Also, notice that today, we managed to close above the intermediate balance area high. I would not be surprised tomorrow if we hold above that level and trade near the POC from last Monday, Thursday, or Friday, which is around 2085. If so, I would consider that bullish, and would be looking to put on some type of a credit trade that captures a move into the 2100 level going forward.

For me to switch my bias to bearish, I would need to see the 2067 level fail. If we close below there with signs of stronger selling, I'll be looking to target the other side of balance, which is down at 2012. More intermediate targets would occur along the way, but they'll be noted when we do break 2067.

That's it for today. For now, I'm still keeping my bias neutral, but watching for any bullish/bearish signals.
