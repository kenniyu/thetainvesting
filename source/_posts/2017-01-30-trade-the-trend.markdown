With the market pulling back, watch how SPX tests the upcoming 50MA below.

<h3 id="20170130-mcd">MCD</h3>

For stocks that showed relative strength, MCD may do well if the trend continues long and strong tomorrow. Here's the daily chart. Initiating a long if that trendline holds tomorrow will not be a bad idea, as it is with the trend.

<h3 id="20170130-xec">XEC</h3>

For stocks that may pull back harder, check out XEC. This has earnings coming up, but I would look out for how the 200MA holds. Keep it on your radar for a potential buy opportunity if we retrace back to the 200MA.

On the other front of energy, here's a stock that showed relative strength and has bounced quite hard from all of the MAs. I'd wait for a pullback to get a better trade location.

<h3 id="20170130-clx">CLX</h3>

And for a stock to short, here's one that's holding nicely below the 200MA. Watch out for earnings. This would be a good short if the 20 and 50MAs did not hold.
