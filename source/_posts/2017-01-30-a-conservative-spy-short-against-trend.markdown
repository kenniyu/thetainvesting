Many bears coming out today.

It's always quite hard to fight against the trend - bears usually find themselves frustrated as it has taken some time for down moves to play out.

Knowing this, it's possible to put on a trade that captures a slow dribble down to the middle of the channel we've been forming on the SPY. Observe chart below:

If we're looking for a pullback to near the 222.5 level, we can buy a 5-point wide Feb put butterfly centered around there, currently going for .74 debit:

Profit target should be about half the max profit, or 2.50. That's roughly a bit over 3R. Adjust number of contracts to fit your risk tolerance.
