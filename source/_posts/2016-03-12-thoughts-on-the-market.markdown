I'll admit, I have not participated as much as I should have in the rally from the February lows.

In hindsight, that is the biggest mistake I've made this year. It was clearly a double bottom, and when fueled by short-covering, became a very powerful rally. All I had to do was go long the market, or any stock for that matter, and I would've been able to capture a lot more gains. Instead, I focused on the points that the market could possibly stall and turn around to go lower, and I was prepared to short at those points. And because I was so focused on preparing to short, I did not think about going long.

Obviously, that type of thinking has caused me a lot of lost opportunities. So, in order to correct this behavior, and to help set it in stone, I think it's beneficial for me to write out these thoughts so that I can come back here whenever similar situations occur in the future and set myself straight.

As much as I'm punishing myself for missing out on the rally, my sentiment on the market still remains - I don't believe in the rally that we've had from the February lows. That does not mean I won't be taking advantage of any bullish signals and trading them. It simply means, fundamentally, I don't believe our economy is any better. I believe our central bankers will run out of juice one day. At some point, the market has to correct, and I just don't see us making new highs in our current conditions.

Take a look at some of the famous, big-name stocks like FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG, CMG, AAPL, etc. I would've expected these stocks to rally a lot higher in conjunction with the SPX - at least if it had done so, it would've shown that risk was back on. Instead, they all look very weak; it doesn't seem like investors are all that excited about these stocks anymore. Furthermore, it appears we've rotated to defensive sector stocks like energy, and based off of what? Crude oil's fundamentals being better? I don't think so. In fact, I have no idea.

We started this year at 2038.2 in the SPX. We're currently at 2022.19. If we breach 2038.2 with vigor, I believe the next point of resistance is 2060:

Because a lot of overhead supply is above us, I think it makes sense that we won't be surging sharply higher - instead, we'll probably slowly float upwards. So I'll leave you with a trade idea: the 2055/2060/2070 unbalanced butterfly (currently priced for 0.15 cr) expiring March:

The max loss here is the 5.00 - .15, or $485 per spread.

This will need to be price-discovered again on Monday. If the credit is still good, and if the SPX looks like it's going to be slowly grinding higher, I would put this trade on.

That's it for now. Enjoy the weekend everyone.
