The market broke out of balance very clearly today to the upside as we mentioned yesterday:

We attempted to trade back below balance, but failed as buyers kept the market up.

On the SPX, we now have clearance to tag the uppermost trendline resistance this Friday at around 2090.

Also, from now on for the SPX chart, the pink rectangles will be removed - the target here has been reached.

Watch for the top of the balance area to hold as support, because we can just as easily fail tomorrow and fall back into the balance area, which is not a strong Bullish signal. If that's the case, I'll be looking for a rotation all the way back down to the bottom of the balance area (2012) as a weekly play. However, tomorrow, I'm looking for some consolidation before any moves higher.

One of the plays that I'm looking at currently is the SPY MAY2/APR5 211/210 Diagonal Call spread, currently going for about .26 debit:

This has breakevens at around 206 and 212 over the next few weeks. Given the low volatility that we've been having and the low confidence in any downmove, as long as we stay in this range, we should be good to milk some premium. I'll be looking to put this on tomorrow.

That's it for today. I'll keep posting new entries/adjustments on Twitter, so be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get all of my updates in real time.

Good luck in the markets and good trading!
