All broad market indices traded lower today.

This could be the start of a new (down) trend, but given how nervous traders are out there, I would not be surprised if we gap up tomorrow; thus, monitor the markets for a continued move down.

Let's take a look at a couple of bearish trades that may pan out if the market continues to roll over:

/CL erased all of its gains from yesterday - this is quite bearish. Look for a break below 36. If sellers start coming in hard, then we've got a "look above and fail" pattern, which would be a short signal. Keep a close eye on this.

CMG exhibited a dark cloud cover pattern today, with a double top on the daily, and a small topping tail. The APR 600/610 call spread is currently trading for 0.97 cr.

TRIP has been a bit confused about where it wanted to go for the previous 4 days before today. Today's price action broke us out of a rising wedge. If bearishness continues, we can easily head to the lower 50s.

That's it for today. Good luck in the markets tomorrow. Stay small, and stay safe.
