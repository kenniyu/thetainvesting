This time, it's not the car that's on fire, but the stock. Please observe the chart of $TSLA below:

$TSLA has been a monster of a stock, running huge from the lows of 180. In yesterday's session, it managed to close just a few ticks below the high from two weeks ago. If we break that high, we can look for $TSLA to continue running higher to test the next high at around 270.

One potential trade idea is the 270/280 vertical call spread expiring next Friday, currently going for 1.12 debit:

Those that don't believe $TSLA can break past 280 can finance this call spread by selling additional 280 calls, essentially turning this vertical spread into a backratio:

Keep in mind that naked calls do have unlimited upside risk!
