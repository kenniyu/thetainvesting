There isn't a lot pointing to the Bears being in full control, yet. For now, it still appears to just be consolidation. I am still watching for a break below 2033.5 on the /ES with strong follow-through before I turn bearish.

Looking at the SPX:

[![SPX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Look-Above-And-Fail](/images/blog/04052016/spx.png)](/images/blog/04052016/spx.png)

Today it appears we formed a look-above-and-fail pattern - I'd like to see follow-through to the downside for confirmation.

DJX:

We closed just at trendline support. Let's see if it holds.

NDX:

This appears to just be consolidating over the past 5 trading days.

RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Consolidation](/images/blog/04052016/rut.png)](/images/blog/04052016/rut.png)

We're now below the 61.8% Fib level. We've now traded near and around the 61.8% Fib level many times - consolidation is still happening here.

Ok - we haven't been putting on many trades this week. This is largely due to my reluctance to sell premium in a cycle that contains earnings, but I've managed to find some that avoid it with good weeklies.

I wanted to go back to GS which I mentioned the other day:

Though this play contains an earnings cycle, I've noticed that it doesn't quite move much from earnings reports. I wouldn't mind putting this on tomorrow - with pretty wide breakevens, we can aim for a move towards both ends of the spectrum, regardless of which way the market moves. Just as long as it doesn't crash, of course. This is currently being priced in at a .67 cr.

I've also got a couple of calendars/diagonals for play here.

Here's DIS:

Aiming for 90 by the 4th week of April:

Here's EEM:

[![EEM - 2016-04-05 - Daily](/images/blog/04052016/eem.png)](/images/blog/04052016/eem.png)

Aiming for 30 by the 5th week of April:

Here's CMG:

[![CMG - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Slow Grind to 420](/images/blog/04052016/cmg.png)](/images/blog/04052016/cmg.png)

I'm looking for a slow grind down to 420:

All of these require a debit, but when volatility is low, these are good deals. If we get the directional move we want and volatility expands and time decays the nearer-term option, the spread can really expand nicely.

That's it for now. I'll most likely be putting these trades on, so [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get my updates. Also, to make the most out of Twitter, make sure you turn on notifications specifically from me. Just visit my Twitter profile on mobile, select the Settings gear, and turn on notifications.

Good luck in the markets tomorrow!
