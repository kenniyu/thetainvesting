/ES broke out of the descending channel yesterday and closed strong above it. This is slightly bullish, but in a long term perspective, still neutral:

[![/ES - 2016-05-25 - 1h Chart - Volume Composite](/images/blog/05252016/es.png)](/images/blog/05252016/es.png)

I'm expecting tomorrow's action to pause a bit, especially after such a rally. If this happens, it only makes the developing volume node at 2075 more prominent.

Watch how the volume composite develops throughout this week. 2075 to 2085 could become the high volume node over the past 30 days. Also, developing value at the upper end of the balance area primes us for a stronger breakout to the upside.

That's it for the market outlook. As always, we'll be entering new trades and adjusting/exiting our existing positions, so be sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter").
