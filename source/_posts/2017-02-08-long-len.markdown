One of the things we look for when placing trend trades are those that are also supported by technical analysis. One in particular is $LEN.

Please observe the chart below.

$LEN has pulled back to the moving averages and continues to consolidate here for the past couple of weeks, but as part of a rising channel. We can look to initiate a long position closer to the bottom of this consolidation area around 44.60, or look to enter on a break above 45.38. Stop loss will be placed at 42.69. Adjust number of shares to suit your personal risk tolerance.
