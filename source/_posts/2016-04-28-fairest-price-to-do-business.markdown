Taking a look at the volume profile:

[![/ESM6 - 2016-04-28 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile](/images/blog/04282016/es.png)](/images/blog/04282016/es.png)

Yesterday, although we ripped higher into the end, value was still mostly unchanged, with the POC hovering near 2083.5. Again, this is practically where the POC has been on Tuesday, last Friday, last Thursday, and last Monday. Regardless of trendlines and such, the transactions shown by the profile tell us that this area is the fairest price to do business.

Currently, /ES is trading at 2078, 13 points from yesterday's settle. I would like to see if value can migrate lower back into the intermediate balance area denoted by the range between 2067 and 2081.75. Will the POC develop near this Monday's POC? To give any edge to the Bears, we need to move value area back into this intermediate balance area and take out 2067. Currently, there is just not enough seller strength at all, so my bias remains neutral to bullish.

I'll be looking to see how 2083.5 plays out today. On the open, if we climb higher and tag that POC and we manage to continue trading there, then essentially nothing has changed from yesterday. If we tag that POC but fall back down and start developing value lower, that's an edge to the Bears. But again, that's if sellers step up.

That's it for today's morning market outlook. I'll be looking to put on more trades today as I haven't done much of it this week.
