Chipotle has had a pretty bad run over the past year. Even if you didn't own the stock and just ate there, well, you were probably given a bad run as well. At ThetaTrades, we like to trade potential trend reversals, meaning that a close above the 200MA would signal an entry. $CMG is one of these candidates and could be making another run higher, hopefully for the better this time. Please observe the chart below:

[![$CMG - 2017-02-22 - Daily](/images/blog/20170222/cmg.png)](/images/blog/20170222/cmg.png)

Over the past four trading days, $CMG has held above the 200MA. Still close to the moving average, one can look to initiate a long position, with entry at around 430, and a stop loss below the 200MA, far enough to avoid the average noise the stock makes. As such, the stop could be placed around 403.67. Once set, if $CMG does take off, we simply enjoy the ride, and continue trading the trend, while moving our stops up with the 200MA.
