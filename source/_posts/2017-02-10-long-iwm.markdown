Similar to the $FNF trade idea that we brought up earlier this week, $IWM is also set to explode higher. Please observe the chart:

$IWM has repetitively held the 200MA and is looking to break out of a long, bull flag consolidation pattern. Immediate objective here is around 140. A failure of 132.27 (stop loss) invalidates our near-term bullish assumption. Consider going long stock or call options.
