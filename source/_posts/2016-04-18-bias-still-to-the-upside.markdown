Market trucks relentlessly to the upside, and bias remains to the upside until market starts to show signs of sellers.

Here's the SPX:

We closed just above that trendline, which can now be considered broken. The next target here is 2100, followed by 2115.

Here's the DJX:

Bullish here as well. We closed above the highs of November from last year. The next target would be around 181.9.

Here's the NDX:

The weakest of the bunch, but it closed at the trendline resistance and has room to run to the upside. First target is the gap fill of 2016, which is just about 20 points away.

Finally the RUT:

This broke the trendline resistance very cleanly. The next major resistance is around 1200.

Today, we put on the trade discussed yesterday for the RUT - you can see that post [here](/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish/ "RUT Call Calendar Spread").
