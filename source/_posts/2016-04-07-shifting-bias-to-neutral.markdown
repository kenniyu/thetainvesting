Short term traders still remain in control.

The price action has been volatile and we've been having 100% retracements within very short periods of time - i.e. swings from one side of the lows to the highs the very next day. Just two days ago, shorts who tried to push the market lower by the end of the trading session got punished the very next day by the Bulls who took the market all the way up to the highs yesterday. Now, today we've just reversed all of that and traded even lower today. There's no doubt that shorter term traders are in control here.

Today's action touched yesterday's point of control early in the session before failing there, and for the rest of the day, traders built value lower to almost not overlapping. We even took out the weak reference point of 2033.5 and tagged the point of control going back to the Fed day shown by the 3 blue distribution areas on the left side. By the end of today's session, the POC migrated lower to near Apr 5th's POC.

Today was a very interesting day and it appears that the sellers are finally getting some control. Instead of being bought up after gapping down this morning, we actually continued selling and sentiment remained bearish all day.

Zooming out over the past 20 days, here is the volume profile:

Here are the reference points to watch out for tomorrow (and this is important due to the short term traders dominating):

**Settlement**: 2034.75<br/>
**POC**: 2040<br/>
**Value area high**: 2043<br/>
**Value area low**: 2029.75<br/>

Tomorrow, if we gap up, here's what I'll be watching for:

1. How far of a gap are we gapping up by? Anything around double digits is going to be a hard gap to fade unless internals are very bearish. If internals do show strong bearishness, I would look to target the POC and then after that, the settlement, then the value area low, then today's low (2026), then low of the Fed day (2019), then 2012 (the unvisited high of the March 16 spike). Watch for a bounce at any of these levels and look at internals for confirmation.
2. Are we opening up inside of value area? If so, observe how traders behave - do they want to take it outside of value area and explore higher, lower, or just keep it near the POC? Again, if internals aren't confirming a strong move up or down, then the value area high is most likely a short, and the value area low is most likely a buy. This is just responsive trading. If internals are strong enough for us to break out of value area, then a break below value area is a short, and a break above would be a buy.
3. How far of a gap down are we gapping down by? Anything around double digits is going to be a hard gap to fade unless internals are very bullish. If internals do show strong bullishness, and we try to go lower but fail and instead we take out the overnight low, I would look to target the yesterday's low and then after that, the value area low, the settlement, then the POC and then value area high, and then from there, yesterday's POC at around 2050. Watch any of these levels for a potential short as well, and watch the internals for confirmation.

That's it for today. I don't have trade setups for tonight, but if you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter"), you will be able to see every trade that I enter, adjust, and exit, and my live market commentary.

Good luck in the markets tomorrow!
