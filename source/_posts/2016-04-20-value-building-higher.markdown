Value builds higher:

[![/ES - 2016-04-20 - Volume Profile](/images/blog/04202016/es.png)](/images/blog/04202016/es.png)

Towards the end of the trading session, we had a nice liquidation break, and we bounced right off yesterday's value area high. So still, very short term reference points in play here. Regardless, this is still bullish, as value continues to build higher, and volume POCs continue to move higher. This liquidation break only strengthened the market.

*Bias is still bullish until sellers step up.*
