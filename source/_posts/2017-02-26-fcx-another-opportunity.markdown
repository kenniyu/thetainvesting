Hey traders!

One of the things that we love most about stocks is trading them in the direction of the trend, at an area of value. By area of value, we mean at places like retracements. One particular stock that shows this is $FCX. Check out the chart below:

[![$FCX - 2017-02-26 - Daily](/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png)](/images/blog/20170226/fcx.png)

With a pullback to the 200MA, FCX provides a good long entry at 13.25. As this stock tends to overshoot past the 200MA, one can consider entering a bit beneath it as well. However, the stop placement should take that into consideration as well and be placed well below it. Though a further stop reduces the size of the position one can place, it also allows us to ride the trend longer. If anything, we can always add to the position on another pullback if $FCX does continue higher.
