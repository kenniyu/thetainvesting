The market continues to rally on poor structure. Today after Yellen's speech, the /ES created three distributions, separated by single print spikes:

I've highlighted the distribution areas in blue. These single prints tend to act as levels for bounce plays, especially when the market is dominated by mostly short-term traders. For tomorrow, keep these weak reference points in mind. These are 2043.50 and 2033.50.

Here are the broad market indices:

SPX:

This will most likely reach our 2060 target.

DJX:

A retest of the trendline resistance.

NDX:

This is well on its way to the trendline resistance.

RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-03-29 Daily Time Frame](/images/blog/03292016/rut.png)](/images/blog/03292016/rut.png)

Closing above the 61.8% Fib level.

Bias remains bullish, so don't fight it.
