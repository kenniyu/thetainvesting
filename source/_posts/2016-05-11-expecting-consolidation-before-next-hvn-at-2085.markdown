We had a tremendous rally yesterday:

[![/ES - 2016-05-11 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile & 20d Composite](/images/blog/05112016/es.png)](/images/blog/05112016/es.png)

Profile is a bit stretched and volume a bit low; regardless, the edge here is clearly to the Bulls. [As mentioned yesterday morning](/blog/2016/05/10/mind-the-hvns/ "Mind the HVNs"), for the Bulls, we were looking for a move to near one of the HVNs, either 2075 or 2085. We got that first one, with yesterday's POC right at 2074.50, so the next target now is 2085.

Bias here is now slightly bullish. I wouldn't be surprised to see some consolidation or retracement here before we continue the movement higher. However, an entire retracement of yesterday's upmove puts yesterday's rally into question, so watch out for that as well.

I mentioned I would place some trades near the HVNs of 2075 and 2085, but due to lack of good pricing, I wasn't able to find one. However, I'll still be looking for some, possibly to the downside as well, so stay tuned.

That's it for today's market outlook. If you haven't already, make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to receive my tweets in real time. I'll be posting all of my trade entries, adjustments, and exits.
