Yesterday's trade was very evenly distributed around the POC, with a small value area range, so it was a fairly decent balance day:

[![/ES - 2016-05-10 - 5m Chart - Volume Profile](/images/blog/05102016/es.png)](/images/blog/05102016/es.png)

Traders were able to find acceptance back in the upper distributions of last Thursday's and Friday's trade. They managed to build value higher, albeit overlapping, thus not really a sign of any momentum. Again, we're seeing low confidence as traders have no idea where to go from here.

/ES is currently trading at 2062. Overnight inventory is net long. On an intraday basis, when we open, watch the internals and see if the $TICKs have a hard time reaching 0. That will tell you whether or not there is a gap fade play. If the $TICK quickly shoots downwards, here are some downside targets for the gap fade:

1. yesterday's high at 2057.75
2. value area high at 2056.75
3. POC at 2054
4. value area low 2051.50
5. yesterday's low at 2048.25

Note the High Volume Nodes (HVN) at around **2051**, **2075**, and **2085**. Remember that prices tend to get pulled in those directions. With the /ES currently at 2062 (low volume node), expect prices to migrate away from here and possibly find acceptance near one of the HVNs.
