Session today clearly showed that the bears simply did not give a shit about taking the market lower.

Here's the hourly chart of the /ES. Yesterday showed that the breakout had been a look-above-and-fail. Usually, when we break back into the red balance area, we can expect to rotate to the other side of balance, or 2250. Today was the day for the bears to follow-through and do just that. But notice how when we broke yesterday's low, we only did so by 1 point and couldn't even push further. If the Bears really gave a shit about Trumps immigration ban, they would've sold it off harder. Guess what? When you look behind you and realize no one's pushing with you, you'll cover your shorts, and that's exactly what we got towards the end of the session.

Overall, the trend is still up. I'm expecting /ES to test the highs again, especially since overnight highs generally don't mark the end of the move (highest point so far was the overnight high made on 1/25). Here are some trade ideas to the long side:
