Hey traders!

[Similar to our long idea on $TDC](/blog/2017/02/27/long-tdc/), $DISCA also provides the a great setup for us. Please observe the chart below:

[![$DISCA - 2017-02-28 - Daily](/images/blog/20170228/disca.png)](/images/blog/20170228/disca.png)

With a pullback to the 20MA, $DISCA offers a good location to get long. Our stop would be around 26.07. As $DISCA moves up, we'll also trail our stop below the 200MA.
