Hey traders,

You probably know that $SNAP went public less than a couple of hours ago. One question you might be thinking:

*Should we trade it?*

This all depends on your own system. However, here at ThetaTrades, we're trend traders, and we look at the 20, 50, and 200 day moving averages. Since it's $SNAP's first day, we don't have the data necessary for our trend following system. Therefore, we will not be trading $SNAP. Simple as that!

If you do trade it, may we wish you the best. Cheers!
