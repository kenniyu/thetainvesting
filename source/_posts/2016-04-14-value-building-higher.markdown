Market remains strong as value builds higher:

We were able to hold above the balance area for the second trading session after the breakout. Stay with the trend, and that is up. Any kind of a pullback on not-so-bearish internals can be considered buy points, as short term traders are still the most dominant traders out there in terms of price action. 2067 would be that point.

We are at some very interesting points in the broad market indices, so just wanted to briefly present them.

Here's the SPX:

[![SPX - 2016-04-14 - Daily](/images/blog/04142016/spx.png)](/images/blog/04142016/spx.png)

We're just about 10 points away from 2092 on the SPX, which would be the trendline resistance point by tomorrow. As mentioned yesterday, we expected a consolidation day today, and that is exactly what we got today, that Doji. Watch for either a continuation or a reversal tomorrow.

Here's the DJX:

We just barely tagged the high from back in November, closing on a spinning top. Again, watch for a continuation or a reversal tomorrow.

Here's the NDX:

Very similar here as it's also closing today on a Doji like the SPX after tagging that trendline resistance.

And the RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-04-14 - Daily](/images/blog/04142016/rut.png)](/images/blog/04142016/rut.png)

Touching that trendline resistance today and closing on a spinning top.

These are all very similar patterns across all the indices, so we shall see how this all plays out tomorrow.

That's it for today. I'll keep posting new entries/adjustments on Twitter, so be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get all of my updates in real time.

Good luck in the markets and good trading!
