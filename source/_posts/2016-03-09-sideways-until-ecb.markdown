The markets continue to move sideways before the ECB announcement tomorrow. Not a lot of volume was traded today. Be cautious heading into the event.

TRIP continues to move to the downside. For those who shorted this from yesterday's trade idea, just trail your stop loss. We may get another bounce at around 60 (we got one today) before we head to the previous lows.

CMG gapped lower due to some news. For those who shorted this from yesterday's trade idea, just continue to trail your stop loss here as well.

Personally, I don't know how much Draghi can do to rally the markets higher. In my opinion, whatever easing he's thinking of implementing is already priced in by the market. If he fails to deliver nothing more than a huge amount of money, the market will probably not take that as a good sign. Just saying. Whatever the case, be prepared.

That's it for today, have a safe trading day tomorrow.
