Today's action is just balancing after a trending move. For me to consider this bearish, I'd want to see 2033.5 on the /ES get taken out. I'd like to see value move lower as well. Also, the highs from the overnight session usually don't mark the end of up-moves, so expect 2071.5 to be revisited sometime soon, and if it doesn't, carry that information forward.

Here's the SPX:

I'm looking for this to hold up at the trendline support. A failure to remain above it is an edge to the Bears.

Here's the DJX:

I'm also looking for this to hold up at the trendline support.

Here's the NDX:

Looks like a pause before a continuation higher.

Here's the RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-04-04 - Daily - 61.8% Fib Level](/images/blog/04042016/rut.png)](/images/blog/04042016/rut.png)

This is a bit more interesting. Still holding above the 61.8 Fib level and may just slowly grind around here until it touches the trendline resistance.

For those looking for a bearish play, I've been looking at CMG. We have a trendline support coming up on the weekly:

As well as a revisit of the prior lows at 400 on the daily:

I'm looking to place a small butterfly to capture a move down into the 400 area:
