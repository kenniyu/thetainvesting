Value gapped lower yesterday and traders found themselves accepting prices just slightly above the high volume node  at 2040.50. As mentioned before, the Bears have a lot to chew through in order to break through the downside, and that is the entire balance area that we see on the left:

Currently futures are gapping up about 7.50, right inside Tuesday's value area and near its POC. Will traders find acceptance again back in this area? If so, we would've had 3 days of overlapping value area (last Friday, this Tuesday, and then today if it happens), and it marks this area as an important short-term balance area.

Reference points for today are 2060 (overnight high), 2053.50 (yesterday's high), 2047.50 (yesterday's value area high), 2045.50 (yesterday's POC) and 2041.25 (yesterday's value area low). Watch how the overnight high acts as a reference point: if we rally up to there, but fail to take it out or only take it out by a tick or two and then fail back down, you can look to target yesterday's high back down at 2053.50, followed by the value area high, then the POC, then value area low, and then yesterday's low.

That's it for today's market outlook. Yesterday we managed some positions and opened up new trades. Today, we'll be looking to book some winners if we can exit with 50% profitability.
