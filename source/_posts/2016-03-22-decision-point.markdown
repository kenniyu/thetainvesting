Market stalls here.

We had the SPX close today on a Doji - this doesn't mean a reversal is coming, it just means indecision, or consolidation, before a break out higher or lower. The longer we consolidate, the more forceful the breakout, so do keep that in mind. Here's the SPX:

[![SPX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Target 2060 - Consolidation](/images/blog/03222016/spx.png)](/images/blog/03222016/spx.png)

We actually peeked above the consolidation area not once, but twice, since yesterday. While that may seem bearish, keep in mind we did the same look-below-and-fail today. So still, trade is being dominated by short-term traders.

Here's the DJX:

[![DJX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance Tag](/images/blog/03222016/djx.png)](/images/blog/03222016/djx.png)

It actually tagged that trendline resistance and fell back a bit, which was what we expected. If the markets continue to exhibit weakness tomorrow, I'm considering the APR5 177.5/180 call spread going for .98 cr right now.

Here's the NDX:

[![NDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Grinding Higher](/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png)](/images/blog/03222016/ndx.png)

It actually continued higher today and was the strongest of the bunch. Not surprising here as it was the laggard for most of the huge rally that the SPX had.

And the RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Look Everywhere and Fail - Consolidation](/images/blog/03222016/rut.png)](/images/blog/03222016/rut.png)

Yesterday we were looking for either a follow through higher from possibly a bounce off of the trendline support, but we did not get that. Earlier during today's session, it appeared that yesterday's session was nothing but a look-above-and-fail, but by the end of today, we didn't have a look-below-and-fail, either. Again, indecision here, so keep your eyes peeled.

Overall, the indices spell very mixed signals. On one hand, you have the NDX up and the DJX down, but both SPX and RUT aren't sure where to go. The longer the market stays in a tight consolidation range, the more explosive the breakout. Stay aware.

Today we got filled on three trades:

Potential trades for tomorrow:

Earlier today I was looking at PCLN as a potential candidate for a balanced butterfly, centered around the 1300 level. Here's why:

[![PCLN - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Channel Support](/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png)](/images/blog/03222016/pcln.png)

There is an ascending trendline support which should end up at around 1300 by this Thursday. In the event of a slight downdraft in the markets, we may be able to find support here. There's also a rising channel support going back to the gap up from earnings. This should help the 1300 level act as a support as well.

The 1310/1300/1290 butterfly is currently being priced for about .80 db. I'll be trying to lowball this for about .50.

And for DIA:

[![DIA - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Short & Long Strikes](/images/blog/03222016/dia.png)](/images/blog/03222016/dia.png)

In the market recap before, I mentioned that if the market exhibits weakness and we see all indices drop, a 177.5/180 call vertical on DIA would not be a bad idea.

[![DIA Risk Graoh - 2016-03-22 - Vertical Credit Call Spread](/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png)](/images/blog/03222016/dia_risk_graph.png)

It's currently being priced at about 1.01 cr for the spread expiring on APR5, but depending on when the fill happens and how much the market drops, it'll be lower.

Another trade idea here is GDX:

[![GDX - 2016-03-22 Daily Time Frame - Channel Resistance](/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png)](/images/blog/03222016/gdx.png)

I'm looking for a bit of a pullback from this big run that we've had. As GDX stalls here, I'm hoping to collect some premium on the call side, possibly the APR 21.5 naked call, and I'm also looking to add a more bearish bias, as we're at the top of this channel resistance. To that effect, I'm considering buying the 20/19 put spread, also in APR. Together, this should bring in about .22 cr.
