We all know about the recent rally off of the February lows and how it has devastated the many short players out there. And as you know, I've been harping about this in my recent posts - regardless of how ridiculous this rally may seem to many, we can't fight price action. The point here is that we should simply trade the trend. Thus, continue to keep the 2060 SPX target in mind.

However, don't get me wrong. While the Bulls sure have gotten quite the relief rally they needed after a terrible start in the first month of 2016, and while it may seem as though all is fine and dandy in the equities market because we're now positive on the year, I have one important message for those die-hard Bulls, or those who have missed out on this rally and are considering jumping in for [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out "FOMO")

> Price is simply an advertising mechanism

Price is simply an advertising mechanism. And yes, it's easy to get sucked in by price. We see it every day in our lives - the dealership we drive by promoting the price slash on that shiny car, the cheap deal from the restaurant serving up their burrito bowls with E. Coli additives, the ads on TV from Macy's promoting price cuts on their clothes, etc... But is there any value to these items? Some would argue so, since obviously transactions occurred here before, so of course it has value - someone just bought it at this price level.

But the existence of a transaction happening at that price does not provide enough information as to how much value it really provides. The missing dimensions are **time** and **volume** spent at those levels.

The longer the time that traders spend making transactions at a certain price level, the more value that area has. The same can be said for volume, and we'll take a deeper look at that now.

From a candlestick chart, it's hard to see time or volume spent at each of the individual prices/price ranges. So instead, we'll have to look at the **market profile**, specifically, the volume profile:

This is a rough volume profile of the /ES:

[![/ES - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Volume Composite](/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png)](/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png)

Looking at this recent rally that we've had, we can see how much time and volume was spent throughout each area of this up-move.

The first week of the rally was explosive - we gapped up repeatedly the first few days, creating "single prints" in the market profile as shorts panicked to cover their existing positions. What followed was consolidation around the 1940 area, and then another explosive move higher into the 2000 range before another consolidation, and then finally one more push to our current levels. Each of these pushes can be thought of as being built on "poor structure." That means, not a lot of time was spent developing value throughout all of the areas of this rally - there were only two areas so far that we spent about a week or so, each, developing value in. A healthy market rally, instead of screaming higher with single prints, would gradually develop value higher and higher. The gradual, upward migration of value areas prevents a sell off from breaking through these value areas and eliminating longs quickly; more time and volume spent in these areas means there are many traders interested in prices at these levels.

In contrast, the sharp, "gappy" migration of value is very susceptible to liquidation breaks, as these single-prints or gaps have yet to be filled with value when revisited. However, once price revisits these levels, because no time was spent here, those who got long in these prices will most likely panic, as they did not get in at a value area, but at an area that they felt were "forced" to get in at because they were "chasing" bad location. Subsequently, a chain reaction occurs where longs liquidate at market (think of it as the opposite of a short squeeze).

Zooming out and looking at the bigger picture, when viewing the volume profile of the entire rally, we end up with this histogram on the right (chart shown again):

[![/ES - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - Volume Composite](/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png)](/images/blog/03182016/es_volume_composite.png)

The volume bars on the right is the volume composite, or the sum of all of the volumes at the different price levels for the time frame we're looking at. In the time frame of this ongoing rally, we see that the high volume "node" currently exists at around 1986. This is the fairest price to do business. The second fairest would be at around 1920. Everything in between (the valleys) are subject to liquidation breaks. In essence, price tends to trade near peaks, and it tends to move away from valleys. Keep this information in mind for when we do begin to trade away from the peaks.

The tone out there in the market is very bullish, no doubt. But besides the **extremely** poor structure of this rally, another thing that bothers me about this rally is that it is the short term traders that have been dominating price action this past couple of weeks. The reason I say this with confidence is that short term traders usually look at short term time frame reference points, i.e. yesterday's high or low, overnight high or low, etc... and trade mechanically off of these points. And that's precisely what we've had this past week - the prices at which the market has been bouncing from spell out very clearly that the action is dominated by exactly these players.

Specifically, I'm looking at the 1995 level on the /ES:

[![/ESM6 - 2016-03-18 Hourly Time Frame - 1995 Weak Reference Point](/images/blog/03182016/esm6_1995.png)](/images/blog/03182016/esm6_1995.png)

Notice how many times we've come to this level and bounced away from it. Also, notice the distribution areas boxed by the blue areas, with the single prints in between them:

On Thursday's RTH, we came to just 1 tick above the single print spike from Wednesday's RTH and bounced right from there. These weren't value area reference points, but rather short term reference points. Thus, in my opinion, they are weak and should be carried forward into the future for when we do come revisit these points. And when we do, **don't be surprised if all of that poor structure which has been built by short term traders gets wiped out by a hard liquidation break**.

Going forward, I believe we continue rallying to around 2060 in the SPX next week. If we close at or below that point next week, then I think the play would be to take a short there. If we continue selling off, keep those weak reference points I mentioned earlier in mind and know that they are just that: _weak_. We may see a slight bounce at 1995 given how many times we've touched this point, but understand that, because it's a weak reference point, it would probably break on a subsequent touch downwards.

So, if you're a die-hard Bull, or if you've been dying to get in the market, but you haven't yet, it is now very late, so if you do decide to jump in, please be careful and keep those reference points in mind. It is all too easy to fall into the trap of [chasing price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality, "chasing price").
