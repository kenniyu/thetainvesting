Hey traders,

We're currently looking at two potential bullish plays.

First is $PCLN:

We had mentioned to get long [back on Jan 23](/blog/2017/01/23/long-pcln/ "Long PCLN"), and $PCLN has trended nicely since then. However, with the recent three day consolidation, and the bullishness of the market, $PCLN looks ready to break out higher for more upside gains. One can look to add more on a break above 1652.

Second is $TXN:

$TXN has also trended nicely over the past year, holding above the 50MA. We've pulled back to it recently, making it a great location to get long. We're looking to get long above 75.76, with a stop at 72.20. We'll continue staying long as long as trend holds.
