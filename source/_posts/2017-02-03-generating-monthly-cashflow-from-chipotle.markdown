I'm a big fan of generating monthly cashflow. Especially on stocks that show signs of trading near a long-term trendline support.

One of those stocks is Chipotle. We all eat there every once in a while - wouldn't it be nice for us to pay those burrito bowls with premium we collect on this stock? If you're interested, check out the chart below:

This is a weekly chart of CMG. The trendline support is drawn from all the way back in 2008 to the lows of 2009 and swung out to the present. We still haven't quite been able to touch that support recently, but when price explores that level, buyers may step in.

What I like to do every month is sell put spreads below that support level to collect some premium. And if I get assigned the stock, I'll be ok with owning some at that level (and then selling some calls on it). Here's a trade idea you can do every month on CMG:

This is a 365/360 put spread expiring in March, currently going for about .72 credit. That translates to $72 per spread that you put on, and it only requires $500 of capital, or a 14% return on capital - delicious! Time to finance those burrito bowls!
