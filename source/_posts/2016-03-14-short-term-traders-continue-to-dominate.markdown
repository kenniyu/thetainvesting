I'll give a short market update on the broad market indices and then save a post later for possible trade ideas.

Today's price action continues to show some short-term traders here dominating. On the /ES, we tagged the single prints separating the two distributions on Friday, and then instead of pushing prices lower, we backed off and traded back upwards. This shows that shorter term traders are just trading responsively, and it also shows that they're just lacking confidence to push this higher or lower. Furthermore, we closed on a Doji today, so another reason we've got a low confidence market.

SPX is still on track to tag the 2060 level, though to me, the market feels really heavy, and we might not get there. Watch for a possible reversal or breakout tomorrow, as we basically spent the whole day today balancing thus forming that Doji:

NDX crept higher today, and will probably slowly float upwards to the 61.8% fib level:

DJX also looks like it wants to tag that trendline resistance:

RUT here kind of stalling. Continue to monitor that trendline to see if we break it to the upside or fail back down:

Continue to monitor the markets closely. Again, I feel like traders are just tired of pushing prices higher, but we also have Janet stepping up to the mic on Wednesday, so be careful and trade cautiously.
