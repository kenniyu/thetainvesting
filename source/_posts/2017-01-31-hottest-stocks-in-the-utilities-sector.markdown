The Utilities sector, amongst many other sectors, has made a decent recovery and has a lot of room to the upside.

XLU - Steady trend up

Overall, the trend here is clearly up, making it a great sector to go long some stocks.

Here are some of the best stocks to buy, offering great risk/reward in the upcoming short term in the utilities sector:

<h3 id="20170131-lnt">LNT</h3>
[![LNT - 2017-01-31 - Daily](/images/blog/20170131/lnt.png)](/images/blog/20170131/lnt.png)
Great recapture and successful retest of the 200MA. Today confirmed, offering great trade location.

<h3 id="20170131-ppl">PPL</h3>

As discussed in another [recent post](/blog/2017/01/31/why-the-bears-got-trapped/ "PPL Long"). This one closed above 200MA, and continued strength in the sector can get this stock up to previous highs.

<h3 id="20170131-es">ES</h3>
[![ES - 2017-01-31 - Daily](/images/blog/20170131/es2.png)](/images/blog/20170131/es2.png)
Very similar to LNT, with lots of room to the upside.

<h3 id="20170131-xel">XEL</h3>
[![XEL - 2017-01-31 - Daily](/images/blog/20170131/xel.png)](/images/blog/20170131/xel.png)
Very similar to all of the above, also with lots of room to the upside.
