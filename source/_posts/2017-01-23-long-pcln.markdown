With earnings still pretty far away, we're considering long PCLN. Please observe the chart below.

Last week, we broke the descending trendline, but were unable to move anywhere. A lot of balance occured in a relatively small range. We finally saw a move up higher into today's close, and based on that, we will aim to go long with a target set at the 1600 level.
