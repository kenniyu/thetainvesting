I'm continuing to remain cautiously bullish going into next week, given the massive overhead resistance we still have.

Looking at the broad market indices on the weekly, here's the SPX:

We finished last week with a wide body candle after *consolidating* for a couple of weeks prior. This leads me to believe that, if we do continue moving up, the trendline resistance up ahead is less likely to hold, given how close we consolidated just under that.

Here's the DJX:

The previous trendline resistance (now support) is holding up nicely. The same thing can be seen here - consolidation right underneath the 100% Fib level from back in November. This makes me think it's not hard to pierce that resistance level.

Here's the NDX:

Again, same thing.

The RUT probably paints the clearest picture:

We've consolidated over the past two weeks below the trendline and closed the week right up against it. That trendline can easily be invalidated, in which case we'd have clearance to run up to the 1200 levels again.

Given what we just saw in the RUT, come Monday I'm looking to put on a Call Calendar (again?!) in the RUT (unfortunately, the market has been extremely boring recently, and this is one of the bread and butter strategies during times of low volatility):

We'll manage this over the next month. The debit here is quite small for the potential gains we can achieve. If you have a bearish portfolio, this could be quite beneficial if the market does continue running higher.

That's it for this weekend. I'll be posting that trade, along with all other entries/adjustments, live on Twitter, so be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get all of my updates in real time.

Good luck in the markets this week!
