Hey traders,

The energy sector has gotten a lot of questions recently - here's our take on how to trade it. Please observe the chart below:

[![$XLE - 2017-03-02 - Daily](/images/blog/20170302/xle.png)](/images/blog/20170302/xle.png)

For the longest time, the 200MA has held incredibly well. As it's trading around that curve again, $XLE presents a good location to get long. One can initiate a long position at current prices, with a stop around 68.99. Since we're trend followers, we'll continue holding this position for as long as we can, while trailing our stops up as the 200MA curve moves in our favor. As always, our goal is to ride the trend as long as possible, and rely on the rules of the system to get us out.
