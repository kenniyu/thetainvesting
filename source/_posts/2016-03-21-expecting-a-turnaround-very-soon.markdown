We continue to grind higher.

SPX:

The 2060 target mentioned for a while now is just within reach. Due to the slowing momentum, I'm looking to enter into a 2100/2110 short call vertical spread on the SPX, currently going for 1.70 cr once that trendline is reached and we exhibit signs of a turnaround.

DJX:

We tagged the trendline resistance today. I am expecting this to stall around here, while the SPX climbs higher to tag its trendline.

NDX:

We crossed the 61.8% fib level today, so the next level of resistance is the trendline resistance. However, given the slowing momentum we have in all of the other indices, I don't expect NDX to actually reach that trendline resistance on this run.

RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Support](/images/blog/03212016/rut.png)](/images/blog/03212016/rut.png)

The RUT was the weakest of the bunch today, closing down, but still above the trendline support. We'll need to see more follow-through to the upside if the market were truly bullish, but that may be a bit hard given how much we've come off from the lows, and also the fact that there is a 61.8% fib level there as well. I do expect some stalling to occur here, but keep an eye out on this, as we could easily fall below that support, making for a classic look-above-and-fail pattern.

The upcoming week is key and will most likely determine whether or not we get the retracement in the market that many, including me, have been looking for. Keep your eyes peeled.

In the meantime, for those that followed me on Twitter, here is the trade we got filled on today:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s breaking support. BOT BUTTERFLY <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=ctag">$AMZN</a> 100 APR 16 480/475/465 PUT @-.17</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/711923212490121216">March 21, 2016</a></blockquote>

And the risk profile per spread:

Looking at the chart of AMZN on the daily:

[![AMZN - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Approximate Support](/images/blog/03212016/amzn.png)](/images/blog/03212016/amzn.png)

I expect us to find some support around the prior lows in the area of about 475 to 500. Because I didn't have a specific target in mind, only an approximate area, plus the fact that I think we'll stall around there, a theta-positive, risk-defined trade here may not be such a bad idea. If we aren't able to clearly break support (which we couldn't by the end of today, we actually had a look-below-and-fail) and we end up moving higher, we still make money. As for trade management, since we don't want to take on the max loss here, we'll be looking to manage if AMZN does indeed fall down hard.

Also, given how UNG closed today, I think we are in for another leg lower, and the measured target would be 5.61:

[![UNG - 2016-03-21 Daily Time Frame - Trendline Resistance, Fibonacci Extension](/images/blog/03212016/ung.png)](/images/blog/03212016/ung.png)

I would like to see us break the lows of 5.78 first, though. As for the entry point, looking at the chart on an intraday basis, a break below 6.4 should trigger us into the short:

I'm looking to sell the APR5 6.5 call and buy the APR5 6 put for about .17 cr. Look out for my tweet on this.

Last, but not least, HD:

I completely got sidetracked by work while an entry was available here today - unfortunately it seems like we're no longer able to get a credit for putting on the 133/135 call backratio right now (currently going for .09 debit). I'll continue monitoring this for a good entry, and I'll post it live on Twitter as well.

Good luck in the markets tomorrow, and <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates in real-time.
