We had another late-day selloff. Don't be surprised if we gap up tomorrow morning as we have been doing so much these past couple of weeks.

We're still trading within the balance area between 2012.25 and 2067, so things still look neutral to me. The next, intermediate downside reference point is 2026. If we can build value near that area (remember 2025 is the POC from the Janet Yellen day - this is the day with the three blue distributions), then I'd give the edge to the Bears. Until then, bias remains neutral, but be ready because those reference points below us are weak, as can be seen in the 20-day chart:

That's it for today - I'll be posting/adjusting more trades tomorrow, so be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get all of my updates in real time.

Good luck in the markets tomorrow!
