Hey traders,

We particularly like to look for stocks that are currently consolidating with a potential of moving higher with the trend of the market. One particular candidate to put on our watchlist is $SWKS. Please observe the chart below

[![$SWKS - 2017-02-16 - Daily](/images/blog/20170216/swks.png)](/images/blog/20170216/swks.png)

$SWKS has exploded like a firework after earnings and has recently consolidated around the 92 level. As the 20MA catches up, we're looking for buyers to step in and hold price above that curve. We're looking for another set of fireworks - a breakout above 94. It wouldn't be a bad idea to start accumulating some long deltas. For stock, we'll be going long at 91.80 with a stop below the 20MA at 87.46.
