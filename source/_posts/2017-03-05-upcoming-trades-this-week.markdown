There's no doubt that the overall trend of the equities market is up. As such, many stocks are simply following the trend, and so should we. We've been looking at a few charts over the weekend; here are some that stood out as good tickers to get long:

Here's $KHC. We have a nice pullback to the 20MA, offering great trade location. Stop loss can be placed around 87.52, at which point, we'll wait on the sidelines and look to get long again at the 200MA.

[![$KO - 2017-03-05 - Daily](/images/blog/20170305/ko.png)](/images/blog/20170305/ko.png)
Here's $KO. We've broken above the 200MA and closed above it. We can look to get long with a stop at 41.51.

[![$SO - 2017-03-05 - Daily](/images/blog/20170305/so.png)](/images/blog/20170305/so.png)
Here's $SO. We've held above the 200MA. We can look to get long with a stop at 48.04.

As always, think about the risk first, and size up your position according to how much you are comfortable with losing if your stop were to get hit. Once set, enjoy the ride with the trend.
