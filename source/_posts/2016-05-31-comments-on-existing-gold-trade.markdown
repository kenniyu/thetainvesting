Hope everyone had a great Memorial weekend!

Today we placed a couple of new trades, one of them being on Gold:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BOT BUTTERFLY /GCQ6 1/100 JUL 16 /OGN6 (27) 1150/1135/1110 P at .20</p>&mdash; theta (@theta_positive) <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/737632334749388800">May 31, 2016</a></blockquote>

Let's take a look at the daily chart for /GC:

[![/GC - 2016-05-31 - Daily Chart - Channel Support & Analog Retracement](/images/blog/05312016/gc.png)](/images/blog/05312016/gc.png)

There's an analog between the first break of the channel "resistance" and where /GC low-based (first pink rectangle), and where we just broke below that channel "resistance" later again at a higher price and where we may be low-basing going forward (right pink rectangle). We can expect the channel support to hold, and personally I will be long gold anywhere along that trendline. But for now, as long as /GC nears 1150 by expiration, we should be closing this trade out for a profit when the opportunity presents itself.

This trade was posted live on Twitter this morning, and we'll be managing it together there as well.
