Not a lot of updates for today. For tomorrow, keep in mind the reference points pointed out a couple of days ago (those that separate the distributions):

[![/ES - 2016-03-31 - Three Separate Distributions - Weak Reference Points](/images/blog/03312016/es.png)](/images/blog/03312016/es.png)

I've denoted them by the dashed blue horizontal price levels. Also keep in mind the unemployment rate and non-farm employment change data coming out tomorrow at 8:30 am EST. Those could potentially be market movers and may entice more buyers/sellers to come in.

I think this market has been waiting for a move lower, so if we break lower, watch for volume. That will be an indicator of if sellers are still weak out there, or if they're coming in strong.

That's all the updates for today.

Also, no trade ideas planned, but I may be posting new trades live on Twitter tomorrow as I do every day, so you should be [following me](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get my updates in real-time.

In case you missed them, check out the [Trades](/trades "Ongoing Trades") page to see all ongoing trades. The [History](/history "Closed Trades") page shows all of our closed trades.

I wish you all happy trading!
