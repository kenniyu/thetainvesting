Hey traders,

The utility sector in general has been hanging out in an area of value for one to get long. One stock in this sector in particular which just reported earnings is DUK. Please observe the chart below:

[![$DUK - 2017-02-16 - Daily](/images/blog/20170216/duk.png)](/images/blog/20170216/duk.png)

With earnings out of the way, and with it reclaiming the 20, 50, and 200MA via a strong close, $DUK looks like it's positioned for another run up. We'll look to buy if price crosses above 78.90, with a stop at 75.79 to give us some leeway to account for recent noise. As long as price holds and trends upward, we'll continue to hold.
