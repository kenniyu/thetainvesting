We formed two distributions yesterday, with the POC at 2049.25. Although we slowly took trade to the lower distribution of yesterday's trade, value was overlapping to up - not something I would point to as extremely bearish:

Currently, /ES is gapping down about 5 points. As mentioned in previous blog posts, the Bears still have a lot to chew through to get well past the 2040.50 level. The unemployment numbers coming out today could be the deciding factor of whether or not we move up or down. Watch the internals and look for selling backed by volume. If we do head lower, look for a slight bounce at 2032.75. If that doesn't hold, 2012 is that next target:
