In a market that barely moves these days, it's great when the core of your portfolio is theta positive. We already are, but this is just an emphasis on that fact.

The market is still stuck within the large balance area between 2080 and 2012, with 2052 being a very prominent volume node:

[![/ES - 2016-05-24 - 1h Chart - Volume Composite](/images/blog/05242016/es.png)](/images/blog/05242016/es.png)

The next prominent HVN over the past 30 days appears to be 2075, which is towards the upper end of this balance area. 2075 would be the first upside target to aim for if we see the market move higher. Placing a butterfly there for a credit would be a great play, or some kind of a call ratio with more room to the upside. I'll be looking for something to do here.

Volume has been extremely low during these past trading sessions, but for us, it doesn't really matter. Keep that in mind, though, as a breakout of the balance area may cause volume to start picking back up again, and depending on your portfolio, you may need to adjust.

Yesterday we opened new trades on $NFLX, $TGT and $ES_F. These all seem to be looking good so far. Keep an eye on $NFLX - I think it's going to be interesting seeing how it plays out.

That's it for the market outlook. As always, we'll be entering new trades and adjusting/exiting our existing positions, so be sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter").

Good luck in the markets today!
