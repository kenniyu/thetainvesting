We filled the gap today on the SPX from last year's close today:

Let's continue monitoring the higher movement we've had for continuation.

The market is dangerously long here, and I mention that due to the multiple poor structures that this rally has made to get up to where it is right now. This makes the market susceptible to huge liquidation breaks once the bigger players step in. For now, I still don't see many long term players coming in. The action feels very squeezed, but it can continue higher. 2060 is that target I'm aiming for.

For tomorrow, keep an eye out on SPX to see if we find acceptance here. I think we may stall here for a bit as the players from last year decide whether or not to hold or get out. Thus, value may build here before we move higher.
