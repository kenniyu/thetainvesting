[![/ES - 2016-05-13 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile](/images/blog/05132016/es.png)](/images/blog/05132016/es.png)

Yesterday, we had another day where value area overlapped the prior days's value area. Again, this spells low confidence - traders have a tough time getting prices to trend in any direction whatsoever. We had liquidation breaks followed by short squeezes closely following each other in many of the recent sessions (yesterday's price action showed that very clearly), so the struggle between the Bulls and the Bears continue.

The /ES is currently down approximately 4 points at the time of this writing. For today, I'm not expecting much, as I'm still neutral here until we get out of this low confidence environment and are able to establish a trend. Remember guys, don't be fooled by price; continue watching those value areas, and keep in mind the HVN at 2050 below us, and 2075 above us.

That's it for today's market outlook. As a side note, I'll be out of town until 5/23 and will have limited access to the blog during this time; however, I will still be managing our trades, so make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") - that's where I post all of my trade entries/adjustments/exits in real-time. To get the most out of Twitter, turn on notifications specifically from me to be able to get my tweets on your phone as they come.

Good luck in the markets, and enjoy the weekend.
