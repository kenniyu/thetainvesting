Hey everyone!

We have another candidate that presents a long opportunity at a pullback to the 50 day MA - $CLF. Please observe the chart below:

[![$CLF - 2017-03-03 - Daily](/images/blog/20170303/clf.png)](/images/blog/20170303/clf.png)

With a pullback to the 50MA, $CLF provides a good long entry as is. Stop will be placed at 8.49, at which point, we can step back and observe how it trades near the 200MA. As always, size your position according to your personal risk tolerance!
