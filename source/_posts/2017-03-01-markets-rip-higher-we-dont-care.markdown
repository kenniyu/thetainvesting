Hey traders!

As the markets rip higher today, many look towards the news for answers. Thankfully, [they found one]( http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/01/us-markets.html).

**But just how actionable was this piece of news for trend traders?** Or any trader? Meaning, if you had known this information before the speech actually came out, could you have predicted that the market would hit all time highs? And if the market tanked, would you have been able to predict that as well?

Sure, fundamentals may matter, but **unfortunately, they only matter after-the-fact**. The truth is, even if you did know that Trump’s speech would have implied positive news for the economy, the market itself may not take it as positive news (think about companies that come out with great earnings, and great outlook, but still miss the unpredictable expectations of the market). And because the job of the media is to explain market moves, they always do so in hindsight.

It’s time to cut out all the fundamentals, because all they do is create noise, just like the media or FinTwit. **As traders, it’s not our job to predict. It’s our job to simply trade the price**, determined by what the moving averages tell us about prices in the recent past. From that, we’re able to determine the trend and follow it, with proper risk management via position sizing. This is what the trading business is all about.

[If you haven’t read about why we don’t worry about fundamentals, please visit our blog post here](http://www.thetatrades.com/blog/2017/02/28/fundamentals-should-they-matter/).

Until then, trade with the trend, and enjoy the ride.

Cheers!
