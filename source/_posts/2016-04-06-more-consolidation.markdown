Market continues to consolidate here. As I mentioned yesterday, I just didn't see enough sellers, and that spells low confidence.

Looking at the SPX:

Yesterday's look-above-and-fail pattern failed, and now we're back up above the trendline support. All of this just spells low confidence.

DJX:

Couldn't continue lower after testing the support. Once again, consolidating just above the trendline support.

NDX:

We're still consolidating here, though we have a wide body candle.

RUT:

We're now back up above the 61.8% Fib level - again, this spells low confidence. When a price level is traded through many times, it's not a sign of trend confidence, but rather a sign of consolidation, or low confidence.

Today, we put on a couple of new trades, specifically calendar spreads in CMG and EEM. We also made some adjustments to our TSLA position (currently our worst trade so far) and closed out our AAPL calendar (at a profit). Check them out in the [Trades](/trades "Ongoing Trades") page. If you want to be notified when I enter, adjust, or exit trades, make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") so you can receive my updates in real-time. Again, to make the most out of Twitter, make sure you turn on notifications specifically from me. Just visit my Twitter profile on the mobile app, select the Settings gear, and select the *Turn on Notifications* option.

That's it for today. Good luck in the markets tomorrow!
