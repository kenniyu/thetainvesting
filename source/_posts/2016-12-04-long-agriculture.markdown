Agriculture stocks have been getting beat up for a while. Here's a chart of the ags:

As we get closer and closer to touching prior support at 19.55, we'll be looking to initiate long positions in some of the agricultural futures. Some of the stronger agricultural products are soybeans and oats. Let's take a look at those:

**/ZS (Soybeans):**

The trend appears to be positive - both the 200MA and the 50MA are pointing up. We've pulled back into an area of value, which appears to be a decent spot for a buy.

**/ZO (Oats):**

The trend here also appears to be positive - both the 200MA and the 50MA are pointing up. We've pulled back near the 50MA, which appears to be a decent spot for a buy.

Just some directional ideas here.
