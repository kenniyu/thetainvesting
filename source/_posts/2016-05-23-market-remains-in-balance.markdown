Last week, we had a whole lot of nothing, closing the week flat where we started:

Notice the developing high volume node around 2050 on the /ES:

Traders love this spot, and it's smack in the middle of our big balance area. Consider buying wide, weekly butterflies in this area to capture a lot of theta.

So what I'm looking for this week on the /ES is for us to continue staying in balance along this descending channel:

Watch for bounces off of the channel support and resistance.

Last week we booked many winners. We had a few losers which were the small calendar debits we payed for, but they were offset by the winners significantly. As always, we'll be entering new trades and adjusting/exiting our existing positions, so be sure to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter").
