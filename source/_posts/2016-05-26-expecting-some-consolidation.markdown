Here's the volume composite again on the /ES over the past month:

[![/ES - 2016-05-26 - 1h Chart - Volume Composite](/images/blog/05262016/es.png)](/images/blog/05262016/es.png)

I'm still watching the high volume nodes at 2075 and 2085 to see how they develop.

This past week, we've seen value area gapping higher, which is bullish. After a few sessions, expect a pause and some rebalancing before the trend either continues or reverses. We may get that pause today as we're trading near the highest high volume node.

Yesterday we put on call calendars on AAPL and NFLX. AAPL hasn't done much since, but NFLX looks to be trading up 4 premarket. This is good for our short term calendar, but our longer term call ratio will be hurting a bit here. No worries as we have time to work it out, and our breakeven is a bit above 105, which is the gap fill. We'll see what happens and adjust if necessary.

That's it for today's morning market outlook. We'll be doing more trade adjustments today, so as always, make sure to [follow me there](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to receive tweets about our trades in real-time.
