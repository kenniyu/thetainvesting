We formed two distributions yesterday:

[![/ES - 2016-05-03 - 15m Chart](/images/blog/05032016/es.png)](/images/blog/05032016/es.png)

We closed yesterday's trade in the upper distribution, which resides back in the intermediate balance area. The Bulls were able to get trade back up into the lower distribution from last Thursday's trade. I'm not surprised at all - as I mentioned before, I think the trading we continue to see from both the Bulls and Bears is one of low confidence.

Let's take a closer look on the 5-minute chart:

As of now, the /ES is gapping down about 12 points. This is inside yesterday's lower distribution. I want to see how traders acknowledge yesterday's POC at around 2065.75. Do we continue to trade near this POC in this lower distribution, or will traders like the upper distribution more? The former gives me a neutral bias, while the latter gives me more of a bullish bias. A healthy move to the downside would be to gap below yesterday's POC, retrace back up to tag it, and then sell off. Watch for this to happen, as this is a bearish sign. Furthermore, keep in mind Friday's POC at around 2058.50. Ignoring overnight data, this POC is currently untouched. Taking trade lower to that point today is also a bearish sign - watch how traders accept this POC as well.

That's it for today's morning market outlook. Hope you caught some of my trades yesterday - I'll be looking to put on more trades today, so make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter"), as that's where I post all of my trade entries/adjustments/exits as they come.

Good luck in the markets today!
