We continue to chop and grind here on low volume. Nothing interesting happening here that I haven't mentioned before. All of the charts pretty much look the same as Friday, but I'll post them here again.

SPX:

Congratulations if you took that trade with me!

I'll leave you with one trade idea for tomorrow. We've been putting on quite some trades, so its wise we have time each day to manage each as necessary (though not a lot of management has been necessary so far for many of our trades).

Anyway, here's a trade idea on LNKD:

[![LNKD - 2016-03-28 Range-Bound](/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png)](/images/blog/03282016/lnkd.png)

I'm expecting for the stock to slowly grind lower or meander in between the 100 to 125 price range. If it does manage to get down to 100, I'm expecting a bounce to occur, as it has been a while since we've tested that prior support level. Because of these reasons, I think a put backratio would allow us to capture profits on a slow move down, as well as any moves up. Here is the 105/102 put backratio in APR:

We have big downside risk, so management is key here. We may be able to turn this into a cheap butterfly later as well, so stay tuned.

That's all for today. If you haven't yet, make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to receive my trade entries and adjustments in real time.
