Stocks aren't always trending. When they're not trending, they tend to stay sideways (consolidate). During this consolidation period, the range is very narrow, but analogous to a chemical reaction that's just brewing, the stock, upon breaking out, will most likely explode once again and resume trending.

One of those stocks that is set up for such a move is $FNF. Please observe the chart below:

$FNF has been consolidating for the past two trading sessions. Though overbought, conditions may continue to stay overbought for a while. A break above $36.67, with market internals confirming, and we should see this stock run towards $38.50. A potential trade idea is the following:

Consider buying the 36 or 37 call option expiring in 11 days. Buying the 36 call option with $FNF expiring at 38.5 will generate roughly 2.3 * R, while the 37 call option will generate roughly 4 * R. Size your risk appropriately, and to avoid theta decay, consider buying options that are more ITM.
