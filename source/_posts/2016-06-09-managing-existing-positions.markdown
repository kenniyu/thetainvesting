This is the P/L graph for one spread of our **/CL** position - sitting currently in the profit zone:

Switching over to the volume composite and overlaying our risk graph breakevens:

The HVN (high volume node) over the past 20 days resides near 49.2, just a bit under our max profit level. Note that prices tend to get pulled toward HVNs, though we have a trendline (previously resistance) that may act as a support level (blue solid line), and crude may bounce there.

I'm posting our position in crude oil here because it's important to keep a close eye on this. As we come closer to expiration in 6 days, this spread ​*really starts to expand nicely with profits*​ due to the huge theta decay (especially over the weekend, as decay may start to be priced in by tomorrow). Notice how the spread expands as we step one day at a time.

At the same time, profits can also be lost just quickly if we get a big directional move. So it's important to mentally prepare ourselves for the 3 possible situations we may end up in over these next 6 days, and let's plan what we'll do in each case:

1. If crude rips higher, we'll look to roll our call ratio out in time, but not too far up to maintain a decent credit.
2. If crude dips, we'll wait and see how the 49.5 level plays out, as we have a short put there that we'd also like to milk the premium from. Any hard drop below that and we'll close out our call ratio at a big profit and roll the 49.5 put down and out.
3. If crude does nothing and just hovers around where it is, we're golden - there's no adjustment needed, and we continue collecting theta.

Don't forget, if you have multiple spreads, start peeling them off starting tomorrow.

Next is **KORS**. Here's our current risk graph:

And the volume composite:

Note the HVN at around 50.5.

KORS had an amazing run, and I'm expecting it to consolidate a bit here. Let's look to take our spreads off for about 1.00, 1.50, or 2.00. We're not aiming for the max profit on these types of trades, so start to peel these off if you have multiple.

As part of managing our winners, these are the trades we should keep a close eye on because the losers will just work themselves out as winners in the end as time passes. We'll do our best here with these positions. As for the rest, follow them all on the [trades page](/trades "Follow All Trades").
