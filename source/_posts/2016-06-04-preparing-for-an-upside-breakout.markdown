Why next week should be bullish

Much of the trade this past week contributed to developing the big balance area between 2082.50 and 2106:

Notice where most of the volume took place over the past 5 days:

The fairest price to do business appears to be right in the middle of this balance area. This is neutral so far.

However, as a point in the Bulls camp, note how we've had multiple liquidation breaks with no significant follow-through to the downside, and in multiple sessions, we ended with the Bulls taking it right back up to near 2100. On the daily:

Note the bottoming-tail hammers. There are 5 of them all within the balance area. An edge to the Bulls.

Taking a look at the indices on the weekly, here's the SPX:

NDX:

Doji right at trendline resistance. This could make for a big breakout.

RUT:

The strongest of them all, Maintaining the breakout above multiple trendline supports.

Keep these points in mind going into next week. Though we're currently neutral and in balance, the shorts seem extremely nervous and are unable to push prices lower given every opportunity they've had.

Could we continue to remain in balance next week? Absolutely, and if so, the resulting breakout would be more violent. But be prepared for a breakout this coming week to the upside.

This past week, we made many trade adjustments. Keep an eye on [KORS](/trades#KORS "KORS"), [NFLX](/trades#NFLX "NFLX"), [/CL](/trades#CL_F "/CL"), [SQ](/trades#SQ "SQ"), and [SLV](/trades#SLV "SLV") as potential winners to manage. As always, I will be tweeting out entries/adjustments/exits on Twitter, so if you haven't already, make sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get these updates in real-time.

That's it for this week's market recap and outlook. Enjoy the weekend everyone!
