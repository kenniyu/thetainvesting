Markets still remain bullish.

We've had mini-liquidation breaks throughout the trading day - all that does is strengthen the market, as it eliminates the shorter-term, weaker hands, allowing buyers to continue doing what they do - buying.

Taking a look at the SPX:

We had a nice strong close by the end of the trading session.

Here's the DJX:

Also a nice follow through here.

However, the NDX:

Still the weakest of the bunch. This is one that casts a shadow of doubt on the rally - eventually, this, or one or more of the other indices will catch up to the other.

Here's the RUT:

Consolidating after a move higher from yesterday. Watch for a continuation tomorrow. Our [RUT calendar](/trades#RUT "RUT Call Calendar") is still looking good, and we're holding on to it - no need to panic out.
