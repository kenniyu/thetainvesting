We like stocks that break the 200MA as a signal to go long. One of those stocks is $GDX. [Being a top performing sector of the year](http://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=210&o=-perf1w "Top Performing Sectors"), Gold is an asset that catches our eye as an option to go long.

On that note, we'd love to own GDX at the 50MA (marked by the blue curve) - that's near $22.50:

Going to the options table, we can look to sell the 22.5 Put option expiring in March, and collect about .49 in premium:

That's $49 per contract sold. If you don't mind buying 100 shares of $GDX at $22.50, then at least making money while sitting around and waiting for it to come down to that level would be a great way to earn some cash. This trade idea is basically the same strategy as [that of our previous one on $AAPL](/blog/2017/02/04/waiting-patiently-for-aapl-while-getting-paid/ "Waiting Patiently for $AAPL While Getting Paid"). Rinse and repeat is a great way to continuously generate monthly cashflow.
