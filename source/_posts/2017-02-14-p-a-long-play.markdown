We love looking for potential trend changes based off of price trading and holding above MAs. One particular candidate that fits these criteria is $P. Please observe the chart below.

$P has shown some strength recently, holding nicely above all of the MAs. With earnings aside, we're looking to initiate a long trade, with entry at 13.52. Our stop is a close below 11.98. If the MAs hold, this has quite a lot of room to run.
