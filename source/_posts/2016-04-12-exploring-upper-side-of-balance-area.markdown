I'll keep the post today short, as nothing much as changed.

[![/ESM6 - 2016-04-12 - Market Profile - 15d Zoomed In](/images/blog/04122016/esm6.png)](/images/blog/04122016/esm6.png)

We're still inside the large balance area between 2012.25 and 2067. From the movement today, it appears we'll reach the upper side of the balance area tomorrow, and we'll need to pay close attention to the strength of the breakout to the upside from there. Keep in mind 2067 was the overnight high that was had not revisited yet. Intraday tomorrow, we may see multiple touches of this level, and multiple backing-offs. If we do see this kind of action, be prepared for an even stronger breakout.

That's it for today - will keep posting new entries/adjustments on Twitter, so be sure to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/theta_positive "Follow @thetatrades on Twitter") to get all of my updates in real time.

Good luck tomorrow!
