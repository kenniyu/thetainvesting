We continue to float higher:

[![/ES - 2016-03-30 15m Time Frame - Multiple Distributions - Gap Higher](/images/blog/03302016/es.png)](/images/blog/03302016/es.png)

Towards the beginning of today's session we saw a liquidation break which looked like it was going to fill the overnight gap on the /ES - that is what should've happened if the Bears were really here. Unfortunately for them, all we had was a slow grind lower, which wasn't a convincing move (I [tweeted this out](https://twitter.com/theta_positive/status/715222086789111808 "Slow Grind Lower Tweet") as we were gradually trading lower). Not only did we snap higher, but by the end of the day, we weren't able to even fill the gap on the /ES.

What the Bears needed today was a gap down to the lowest distribution (denoted by the bottom-most blue rectangle) and build value there - that would've signified a more bearish signal. Instead, not only did we **not** trade in the middle or top-most distribution, but price actually gapped above and traders accepted prices up at where we currently are. That's quite a bullish signal. On weak structure, of course. But again, don't fight price.

Here's the SPX:

Our 2060 target was reached. That trendline resistance has been broken, and is now meaningless. The next target would now be around 2095.

DJX:

This closed above the trendline resistance, also rendering it useless.

NDX:

This is still on track to touching the trendline resistance.

RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-03-30 Daily Time Frame - Doji Consolidation](/images/blog/03302016/rut.png)](/images/blog/03302016/rut.png)

Closing above the 61.8% Fib level on a Doji (consolidation). This was actually quite weak today. The trendline resistance could be tagged, so look to see if we continue or reverse tomorrow.

By the way, that put backratio that we put on for LNKD yesterday turned out great today. For those of you who are in this trade, if you want to turn this into a 100% winner, 0% risk trade, buy the 98 put to turn the backratio into a balanced butterfly (this put option costs less than the credit we received when we put this trade on). Your max profit is reduced by the cost of this additional put that you buy, and regardless of where LNKD moves, this trade is an absolute winner.
