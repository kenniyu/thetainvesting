If you're like us and you love owning a great stock at a lower price, but want to make money while waiting for it to be cheaper, then you'll like this options trading strategy.

Here's the daily chart of $AAPL:

During such bullish times, the 20 period moving average (marked by the yellow curve) is a decent buy point. Which means, we don't mind owning some stock around the level marked currently by the yellow curve. An even number around this level would be $120.

Going to the options table, we can look to sell the 120 Put option expiring in March, and collect about .41 in premium:

That's $41 per contract sold. If you don't mind buying 100 shares of $AAPL at $120, then at least making money while sitting around and waiting for it to come down to that level would be a great way to earn some cash. If, by the time March expiration rolls around, $AAPL is still not trading near 120, then you can rinse and repeat for April expiration was well.
