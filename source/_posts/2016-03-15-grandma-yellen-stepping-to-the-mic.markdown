Slightly under the weather today, and probably will be tomorrow as well.

Janet Yellen is stepping up to the mic tomorrow, so watch out for movements and stay on the sidelines if need be.

Trade idea that triggered last night was the AUD/JPY. I'm still waiting on UNG to go a bit higher before shorting. Until then, <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my real-time updates on my entries and positions.
