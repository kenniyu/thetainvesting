We ended last week on diverging signals. It's important to look at all broad market indices, so let's do that.

Here's the SPX:

We have a very clear look above and fail, topping tail pattern, which is generally a bearish signal. However, although we closed below trendline resistance, the week did end up positive, so keep that in mind.

Here's the DJX:

This one is a little bit more bullish than the SPX, as we closed just a bit above that 100% retracement level. I do think we start consolidating around this area for a while before we break any higher.

Here's the NDX:

The weakest of the bunch again due to weak earnings from GOOG. It has been unable to close above that trendline resistance, but do keep a close eye on this.

Finally the RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-04-24 - Daily Chart](/images/blog/04242016/rut.png)](/images/blog/04242016/rut.png)

The most bullish of all indices. This one clearly closed the week above the trendline resistance and has a lot of clearance to continue running to 1200.

Going forward, keep a close eye on all of these indices. They're currently divergent, so it's hard to say whether we should remain bullish or bearish going forward. For now, bias remains neutral.
