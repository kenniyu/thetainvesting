As always, we're big fans of trading with the trend. One particular stock showed up in our scans as a great candidate for trend trading - $NOC. Please observe the daily chart below:

In the case of $NOC, the trend is clearly up. This stock has been in an uptrend for a while and has shown to hold the 200MA really well. Following our mantra of trading with the trend, we're looking to initiate a buy at $229.37, with a wide stop below the 200MA at around $217. We'll target the ATH and higher, resulting in a trade that generates roughly a 2*R return. For management, we'll simply trail our stop loss with the 200MA. Barring news/black swan events, we're looking for this stock to continue its trend higher (knock on wood).

Those that are more aggressive and looking to stack more R's can purchase an OTM call option to take advantage of any potential swings higher, like so:

Do be aware of the option's theta decay.
