My stance on the market remains the same as I stated on Friday, so going into Monday, [keep these points in mind](/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/ "The Most Dangerous Aspect of the Recent Rally").

But here's a trade idea going into Monday.

HD is approaching channel resistance:

I expect it to stall here before breaking out, as breakouts from 100% retracements are usually hard to achieve. For that reason, a call backratio would be great here:

Here, we pay a small debit of .06. The max profit is about $190 per spread, with the upside breakeven at  around 137 (unlimited loss if HD continues rising past this level), and the downside breakeven at around 135. We will monitor this trade closely, watching to see if HD signals a strong breakout over the resistance.

I'll be looking to put on this trade on Monday; you can <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive/">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my real-time updates on  this and all of my other trade entries.
