This market has been consolidating in a big balance area for a while now, with the volume POC for the past 15 days at around the 2040.75 level in the /ES:

The composite doesn't look quite skewed in any direction, so I would say we're right in the middle of this entire balance area between 2012 and 2067.

Keep in mind 2012 goes back to a spike high from March 16 (refer to [this post for more info](/blog/2016/03/18/the-most-dangerous-aspect-of-the-recent-rally/ "Weak Reference Points") ), as well as a *close* touch of that point back in March 24. Keep this weak reference point in mind going forward.

Short term traders continue to be the dominant players here, getting themselves overly long or overly short. Until we see some bigger players come into play and break us out of balance, assume that we trade within the denoted range.

Overall, momentum in the board market indices does look like it is slowing and rounding off. My bias here is still neutral, and with such low IV, it doesn't make sense to be selling premium. If you have a directional bias and you're bearish, selling calls might not be a bad idea. Personally, I'd want to be buying cheap OOM calendar spreads.

We haven't really traded options on the indices in a while, but here's a trade idea on the SPY utilizing an OOM put calendar:

We'd like SPY to trade between 190 and 202 by expiration. Adjust strikes as necessary. If you want to collect a credit, you can think about moving the nearer term strike higher.

A simple call credit spread on the SPY is also not a bad idea. I may be looking to put some on this coming week, depending on conditions.

I'm also thinking about a Bullish play on AMZN:

[![AMZN - 2016-04-09 - Daily - Sitting at Horizontal Support](/images/blog/04092016/amzn.png)](/images/blog/04092016/amzn.png)

AMZN is holding up at the horizontal support level and the upward trendline support level. One of the things I'm looking to do is put on a call condor on AMZN that includes the earnings cycle, obviously as an earnings play. I'll also be looking to finance this condor by selling put spreads beneath trendline support for the weeks prior to earnings, as long as the market continues to stay in balance. The reason I'm thinking about putting on this trade is that if the market does continue to stay in balance or climb higher, AMZN usually won't sell off and may even climb higher as well into earnings.

Currently the APR5 660/670/690/700 call condor is being priced in for about .89 debit:

I might buy a few of these. These and the put spreads will need to be managed if AMZN starts to lose the support levels.
