We finally saw a bone thrown to the Bears camp. When traders accepted prices below the value area today, that was a bearish signal. All of this could change, but this is definitely an edge to the Bears.

Here's the SPX:

From a candlestick pattern analysis, on the SPX, we formed a Doji yesterday and traded below that. This is once again negative on the year, so watch for continuation here. 2060 could still be the target until we see more downside.

The DJX:

We fell back from tagging that trendline resistance mentioned a couple of days ago - we may be starting to pick up momentum, so similar to the SPX, watch for continuation as well.

The NDX:

As it has been recently, it was the weakest of the bunch, closing today below the 200 DMA and trading right below the 61.8% fib.

The RUT:

[![RUT - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - 50% Fibonacci Retracement Level - Look Above and Fail](/images/blog/03232016/rut.png)](/images/blog/03232016/rut.png)

The look-above-and-fail pattern confirmed today and we took out all the gains, now sitting at the 50% fib. Also monitor for continuation to the downside here.

Essentially, all indices pointing down, and in my opinion, we should continue to see lower prices.

Here are the trades we entered in today if you followed me on Twitter:

No management is necessary for all current and existing trades. These have been added to the [Trades page](/trades "Trades"), with risk graphs shown. I try to keep the risk graphs up-to-date as often as possible.

With that, I'll leave us once again with just one trade idea for tomorrow - FXI:

[![FXI - 2016-03-23 Daily Time Frame - Fade China](/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png)](/images/blog/03232016/fxi.png)

We had a nice pop from last week, and a nice rally for a whole month now. I think a fade play here would be nice. Something like selling the APR 34 call and buying the 32/31 put vertical. I'll tweet out the trade.

Remember that the markets are closed on Friday.
