##Hey traders, welcome to ThetaTrades!

Before we get started, we wanted to let you know what our mission, vision, and values are so that you know you're in the right place for your trading journey.

**Our mission is to help struggling traders overcome difficulties in the market. Our vision is a world where everyone takes charge of their own trading through reliable information and education, a world without the chicanery of those who continue to take advantage of traders who just want to learn and make money.**

We are all too familiar with the numerous subscription services out there that charge the average trader monthly fees for results that are almost way too inconsistent. And with the presence of many social media streams these days, we understand that much of the noise out there distracts many traders from realizing the ultimate zen necessary for achieving optimal trading performance. We're here to help you cut all of that out. We believe that you don't need to pay for ideas. And you certainly don't need to pay for any sort of predictive technical analysis or special "indicators."

As such, our core values are:

- honesty
- constant learning
- adaptability

We believe that this industry needs more genuine people out there who truly want to help others without anything in return. We believe that in order to make progress in any one's journey, we must be open to constantly learning. And we also believe that in order to survive in the markets (and the world) today, we must be flexible and willing to adapt.

So whether you're a veteran trader looking for trade ideas and performance improvement tips, or just a beginning trader looking to gain some knowledge and experience, we are absolutely here to help. The trading style of our team is trend following, or trading with the trend, with an objective of multiple R gains. Follow along with the our trade ideas and thoughts, and if you're just starting out, feel free to head over to our [resources](/resources) section to familiarize yourself with what we believe are the best books on trading. Any comments or questions are always welcome, so no matter where you are in our site, scroll down to the bottom and leave a comment, and we'll get back to you shortly!
