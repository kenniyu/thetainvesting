- *05-24-2016* - Closing out the long call here. We got the sharp move upwards that we wanted - anything can happen in this market. Though this could continue higher, from where we were, this is a big winner, and we'll take it.

- *04-05-2016* - Looking terrible. This just rallies harder every day, but will continue holding for now
- *04-06-2016* - We closed out our bear call spread for a huge debit today unfortunately to avoid being assigned early on the deep ITM call. We then sold a naked put and a naked call to collect some more premium. So far, this trade is currently NOT profitable by expiration unless we make more adjustments. For now, we continue to hold and see where the next 9 days takes us.
- *04-07-2016* - Nothing much happened today. We continue to hold
- *04-08-2016* - A huge drop today - we continue to hold
- *04-11-2016 - 04-12-2016* - We continue to hold
- *04-13-2016* - The premium is really starting to come in - continue to hold
- *04-14-2016* - We closed our position in APR and essentially rolled the short strikes out and away, allowing us to collect even more premium for less buying power. And actually, we already had some premium come in today. So, we're currently sitting on this new 290/215 strangle.
- *04-15-2016* - More than .50 of premium has come in already just from yesterday. We continue holding and will be looking to close this on Monday
- *04-18-2016* - We tried to get a fill today on this to close out our strangle, but unable to. Will try again tomorrow
- *04-19-2016* - We closed out our strangle today for .63. After managing this trade for a month, it finally came out to be a winner.

- *04-15-2016* - This expired worthless today, collected .30 on this.

- *04-11-2016* - Moved down today in our direction - holding on
- *04-12-2016* - Managing winner here - if multiple contracts, peel off gradually for rest of the week

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - We're at a tiny loss here, but perhaps a Hail Mary run higher this week will save us
- *03-29-2016* - Adjustment: keeping the dream alive by rolling the short call out one week
- *03-30-2016* - No updates here. Will continue waiting for more theta decay and watch for AAPL to hover near 110.
- *03-31-2016* - We got 1 more week here - still holding

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - Using the premium we collected from our winning PCLN trade to finance this lotto play.

- *03-30-2016* - No updates - will hold til expiration
- *03-31-2016* - Expiration tomorrow. If selling this out beats the commissions, I'll probably do so.

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.40**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-29-2016* - Opened up this trade with the intention of having LNKD move down to around the 101 area. Will still be profitable if LNKD moves higher from here.
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - this is currently a 92% probability of profit trade. For those that want to free up buying power, consider purchasing the 98 put to turn this backratio into a butterfly. Your maximum profit is then reduced by the cost of that 98 put, and you will turn this position into one with 100% probability of profit.
- *03-31-2016* - Still holding as is. If market drops hard, this could fall near our short strikes. Big if.
- *04-01-2016* - Closed up this trade and just booking the winner.
