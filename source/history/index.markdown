<h3 id="AMZN">AMZN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-29-2016* - BOT BUTTERFLY **AMZN** 100 (Weeklys) APR2 16 605/615/630 CALL **@.60**

**Closing:** *03-31-2016* - SOLD BUTTERFLY **AMZN** 100 (Weeklys) APR2 16 605/615/630 CALL **@.94**

**P/L**: **+.34**

**Notes:**

- *03-29-2016* - Short-term bullish bias - we want this to expire around 615.
- *03-30-2016* - This is acting right. We continue to hold this
- *03-31-2016* - Nothing wrong with taking profits here. Not sure if AMZN will be able to climb to our short strike by next Friday given its weakness today.

<h3 id="PCLN">PCLN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-22-2016* - SOLD VERTICAL **PCLN** 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL **@1.25**

**Closing:** *03-28-2016* - BOT VERTICAL **PCLN** 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL **@.48**

**P/L**: **+.77**

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - Freeing up buying power, holding up $500 per spread to make .48 isn't great. Nothing wrong with taking profits here.

<h3 id="VXX-20160324">VXX</h3>

**Opening:** *03-22-2016* - SOLD VERTICAL **VXX** 100 APR 16 17.5/15 PUT **@.58**

**Closing:** *03-24-2016* - BOT **VXX** 100 APR 16 17.5 PUT **@.21**

**P/L**: **+.36**

**Notes:**

- *03-24-2016* - Booked this 2-day winner by buying back the short leg and letting the long one expire with .01 remaining (not worth the commissions).
