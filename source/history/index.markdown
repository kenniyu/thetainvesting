**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.92**</span>

<h3 id="PCLN-20160328-20160401">PCLN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-28-2016* - BOT BUTTERFLY **PCLN** 100 (Weeklys) APR1 16 1230/1220/1205 PUT **@.15**

**Closing:** *04-01-2016* - Expired worthless

**P/L**: <span class="pl loss">**-.15**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - Using the premium we collected from our winning PCLN trade to finance this lotto play.
- *03-29-2016* - Most likely going to be a full (.15 db) loser - no adjustment necessary
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - will hold til expiration
- *03-31-2016* - Expiration tomorrow. If selling this out beats the commissions, I'll probably do so.
- *04-01-2016* - Just let this one expire worthless

<h3 id="LNKD-20160329-20160331">LNKD</h3>

**Opening:** *03-29-2016* - SOLD 1 / 2 BACKRATIO **LNKD** 100 APR 16 104/101 PUT **@.44**

**Closing:** *03-31-2016* - BOT 1 / 2 BACKRATIO **LNKD** 100 APR 16 104/101 PUT **@.04**

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.40**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-29-2016* - Opened up this trade with the intention of having LNKD move down to around the 101 area. Will still be profitable if LNKD moves higher from here.
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - this is currently a 92% probability of profit trade. For those that want to free up buying power, consider purchasing the 98 put to turn this backratio into a butterfly. Your maximum profit is then reduced by the cost of that 98 put, and you will turn this position into one with 100% probability of profit.
- *03-31-2016* - Still holding as is. If market drops hard, this could fall near our short strikes. Big if.
- *04-01-2016* - Closed up this trade and just booking the winner.

<h3 id="AMZN-20160331-20160401">AMZN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-31-2016* - BOT 1/3/2 ~BUTTERFLY **AMZN** 100 (Weeklys) APR1 16 595/600/605 CALL **@.28**

**Closing:** *04-01-2016* - SOLD 1/3/2 ~BUTTERFLY **AMZN** 100 (Weeklys) APR1 16 595/600/605 CALL **@.81**

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.53**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-31-2016* - This is a one-day play. A pin at 600 would be nice.
- *04-01-2016* - Booking a quick winner.

<h3 id="AMZN-20160329-20160331">AMZN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-29-2016* - BOT BUTTERFLY **AMZN** 100 (Weeklys) APR2 16 605/615/630 CALL **@.60**

**Closing:** *03-31-2016* - SOLD BUTTERFLY **AMZN** 100 (Weeklys) APR2 16 605/615/630 CALL **@.94**

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.34**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-29-2016* - Short-term bullish bias - we want this to expire around 615.
- *03-30-2016* - This is acting right. We continue to hold this
- *03-31-2016* - Nothing wrong with taking profits here. Not sure if AMZN will be able to climb to our short strike by next Friday given its weakness today.

<h3 id="PCLN-20160322-20160328">PCLN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-22-2016* - SOLD VERTICAL **PCLN** 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL **@1.25**

**Closing:** *03-28-2016* - BOT VERTICAL **PCLN** 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL **@.48**

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.77**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - Freeing up buying power, holding up $500 per spread to make .48 isn't great. Nothing wrong with taking profits here.

<h3 id="VXX-20160322-20160324">VXX</h3>

**Opening:** *03-22-2016* - SOLD VERTICAL **VXX** 100 APR 16 17.5/15 PUT **@.58**

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.36**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-24-2016* - Booked this 2-day winner by buying back the short leg and letting the long one expire with .01 remaining (not worth the commissions).
