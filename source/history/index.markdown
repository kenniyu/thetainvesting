<h3 id="PCLN">PCLN</h3>

**Opening:** *03-22-2016* - SOLD VERTICAL **PCLN** 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL **@1.25**<br/>
**Closing:** *03-28-2016* - BOT VERTICAL **PCLN** 100 APR 16 1375/1380 CALL **@.48**<br/>
**P/L**: **+.77**<br/>
**Notes:** Freeing up buying power, holding up $500 per spread to make .48 isn't great. Nothing wrong with taking profits here.

<h3 id="VXX-20160324">VXX</h3>

**Opening:** *03-22-2016* - SOLD VERTICAL **VXX** 100 APR 16 17.5/15 PUT **@.58**<br/>
**Closing:** *03-24-2016* - BOT **VXX** 100 APR 16 17.5 PUT **@.21**<br/>
**P/L**: **+.36**<br/>
**Notes:** Booked this 2-day winner by buying back the short leg and letting the long one expire with .01 remaining (not worth the commissions).
