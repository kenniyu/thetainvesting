**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">1.20 + 1.03 + 1.05 - 4.28 + .58 - .26 + 1.73 - .63 = **+.42**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-23-2016* - This stock has never been good to me, and we actually had a pretty solid gap-fill and continuation. People just got too overly short this stock yesterday.
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *03-31-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-01-2016* - No updates - we continue to hold
- *04-04-2016* - We turned this into an IC today - just hedging the call spread
- *04-05-2016* - Looking terrible. This just rallies harder every day, but will continue holding for now
- *04-06-2016* - We closed out our bear call spread for a huge debit today unfortunately to avoid being assigned early on the deep ITM call. We then sold a naked put and a naked call to collect some more premium. So far, this trade is currently NOT profitable by expiration unless we make more adjustments. For now, we continue to hold and see where the next 9 days takes us.
- *04-07-2016* - Nothing much happened today. We continue to hold
- *04-08-2016* - A huge drop today - we continue to hold
- *04-11-2016 - 04-12-2016* - We continue to hold
- *04-13-2016* - The premium is really starting to come in - continue to hold
- *04-14-2016* - We closed our position in APR and essentially rolled the short strikes out and away, allowing us to collect even more premium for less buying power. And actually, we already had some premium come in today. So, we're currently sitting on this new 290/215 strangle.
- *04-15-2016* - More than .50 of premium has come in already just from yesterday. We continue holding and will be looking to close this on Monday
- *04-18-2016* - We tried to get a fill today on this to close out our strangle, but unable to. Will try again tomorrow
- *04-19-2016* - We closed out our strangle today for .63. After managing this trade for a month, it finally came out to be a winner.

**Closing:** *04-15-2016* - Expired worthless

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.30**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-31-2016* - Tick tock. 15 days to go (4 of which are weekends) (I am slightly bearish on this)
- *04-01-2016* - This is moving our direction - we continue to hold
- *04-04-2016* - This is moving our direction - we continue to hold
- *04-05-2016* - We bounced a bit today, even better. We want a slow grind down to 33.5, continue to hold
- *04-06-2016* - This ran up hard, but we continue to hold
- *04-07-2016* - Continue to hold
- *04-08-2016* - This ran up hard again, but we'll just let this expire worthless - not worth the commission costs to close, and the margin requirement should be significantly lower by Sunday anyway.
- *04-11-2016 - 04-14-2016* - This will most likely expire worthless, but holding on for any miracle move down
- *04-15-2016* - This expired worthless today, collected .30 on this.

**Closing:** *04-15-2016* - Expired worthless

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.17**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-21-2016* - This is very far from our center, but we put this on for a credit so no problem here.
- *03-30-2016 - 04-14-2016* - No updates. This is so far from our short strike, will let it expire worthless if anything (feel free to take it off to free up BP)
- *04-15-2016* - Just let this one expire worthless today, collected .17 here

- *04-06-2016* - Opening with a slight bearish bias
- *04-07-2016* - Acted right today in our direction. Continue to hold
- *04-08-2016* - Just stalling here. We'll hold and see what next week brings. And we need to keep a close eye on this - the debit on this was a bit large.
- *04-11-2016* - Moved down today in our direction - holding on
- *04-12-2016* - Managing winner here - if multiple contracts, peel off gradually for rest of the week

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - We're at a tiny loss here, but perhaps a Hail Mary run higher this week will save us
- *03-29-2016* - Adjustment: keeping the dream alive by rolling the short call out one week
- *03-30-2016* - No updates here. Will continue waiting for more theta decay and watch for AAPL to hover near 110.
- *03-31-2016* - We got 1 more week here - still holding
- *04-01-2016* - Still holding - this should be interesting come Monday

- *04-05-2016* - Starting to get interesting here. Still holding for more decay around 110.
- *04-06-2016* - Picked up more theta-drain before closing this out - didn't like the strong close. This may run up higher by Friday.

**Closing:** *04-01-2016* - Expired worthless

**P/L**: <span class="pl loss">**-.15**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-28-2016* - Using the premium we collected from our winning PCLN trade to finance this lotto play.
- *03-29-2016* - Most likely going to be a full (.15 db) loser - no adjustment necessary
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - will hold til expiration
- *03-31-2016* - Expiration tomorrow. If selling this out beats the commissions, I'll probably do so.
- *04-01-2016* - Just let this one expire worthless

<h3 id="LNKD-20160329-20160331">LNKD</h3>

**Opening:** *03-29-2016* - SOLD 1 / 2 BACKRATIO **LNKD** 100 APR 16 104/101 PUT **@.44**

**Closing:** *03-31-2016* - BOT 1 / 2 BACKRATIO **LNKD** 100 APR 16 104/101 PUT **@.04**

**P/L**: <span class="pl profit">**+.40**</span>

**Notes:**

- *03-29-2016* - Opened up this trade with the intention of having LNKD move down to around the 101 area. Will still be profitable if LNKD moves higher from here.
- *03-30-2016* - No updates - this is currently a 92% probability of profit trade. For those that want to free up buying power, consider purchasing the 98 put to turn this backratio into a butterfly. Your maximum profit is then reduced by the cost of that 98 put, and you will turn this position into one with 100% probability of profit.
- *03-31-2016* - Still holding as is. If market drops hard, this could fall near our short strikes. Big if.
- *04-01-2016* - Closed up this trade and just booking the winner.
